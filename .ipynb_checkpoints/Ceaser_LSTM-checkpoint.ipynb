      "preface supposing that truth is a woman what then is there not ground for suspecting that all philosophers in so far as they have been dogmatists have failed to understand women that the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to truth have been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman certainly she has never allowed herself to be won and at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien if indeed it stands at all for there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen that all dogma lies on the ground nay more that it is at its last gasp but to speak seriously there are good grounds for hoping that all dogmatizing in philosophy whatever solemn whatever conclusive and decided airs it has assumed may have been only a noble puerilism and tyronism and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood what has actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time such as the soul superstition which in the form of subject and ego superstition has not yet ceased doing mischief perhaps some play upon words a deception on the part of grammar or an audacious generalization of very restricted very personal very human all too human facts the philosophy of the dogmatists it is to be hoped was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards as was astrology in still earlier times in the service of which probably more labour gold acuteness and patience have been spent than on any actual science hitherto we owe to it and to its super terrestrial pretensions in asia and egypt the grand style of architecture it seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with everlasting claims all great things have first to wander about the earth as enormous and awe inspiring caricatures dogmatic philosophy has been a caricature of this kind for instance the vedanta doctrine in asia and platonism in europe let us not be ungrateful to it although it must certainly be confessed that the worst the most tiresome and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist error namely plato s invention of pure spirit and the good in itself but now when it has been surmounted when europe rid of this nightmare can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthier sleep we whose duty is wakefulness itself are the heirs of all the strength which the struggle against this error has fostered it amounted to the very inversion of truth and the denial of the perspective the fundamental condition of life to speak of spirit and the good as plato spoke of them indeed one might ask as a physician how did such a malady attack that finest product of antiquity plato had the wicked socrates really corrupted him was socrates after all a corrupter of youths and deserved his hemlock but the struggle against plato or to speak plainer and for the people the struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of christianity for christianity is platonism for the people produced in europe a magnificent tension of soul such as had not existed anywhere previously with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals as a matter of fact the european feels this tension as a state of distress and twice attempts have been made in grand style to unbend the bow once by means of jesuitism and the second time by means of democratic enlightenment which with the aid of liberty of the press and newspaper reading might in fact bring it about that the spirit would not so easily find itself in distress the germans invented gunpowder all credit to them but they again made things square they invented printing but we who are neither jesuits nor democrats nor even sufficiently germans we good europeans and free very free spirits we have it still all the distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow and perhaps also the arrow the duty and who knows the goal to aim at sils maria upper engadine june chapter i prejudices of philosophers the will to truth which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise the famous truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect what questions has this will to truth not laid before us what strange perplexing questionable questions it is already a long story yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful lose patience and turn impatiently away that this sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves who is it really that puts questions to us here what really is this will to truth in us in fact we made a long halt at the question as to the origin of this will until at last we came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question we inquired about the value of this will granted that we want the truth why not rather untruth and uncertainty even ignorance the problem of the value of truth presented itself before us or was it we who presented ourselves before the problem which of us is the oedipus here which the sphinx it would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation and could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before as if we were the first to discern it get a sight of it and risk raising it for there is risk in raising it perhaps there is no greater risk how could anything originate out of its opposite for example truth out of error or the will to truth out of the will to deception or the generous deed out of selfishness or the pure sun bright vision of the wise man out of covetousness such genesis is impossible whoever dreams of it is a fool nay worse than a fool things of the highest value must have a different origin an origin of their own in this transitory seductive illusory paltry world in this turmoil of delusion and cupidity they cannot have their source but rather in the lap of being in the intransitory in the concealed god in the thing in itself there must be their source and nowhere else this mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which metaphysicians of all times can be recognized this mode of valuation is at the back of all their logical procedure through this belief of theirs they exert themselves for their knowledge for something that is in the end solemnly christened the truth the fundamental belief of metaphysicians is the belief in antitheses of values it never occurred even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold where doubt however was most necessary though they had made a solemn vow de omnibus dubitandum for it may be doubted firstly whether antitheses exist at all and secondly whether the popular valuations and antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their seal are not perhaps merely superficial estimates merely provisional perspectives besides being probably made from some corner perhaps from below frog perspectives as it were to borrow an expression current among painters in spite of all the value which may belong to the true the positive and the unselfish it might be possible that a higher and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to pretence to the will to delusion to selfishness and cupidity it might even be possible that what constitutes the value of those good and respected things consists precisely in their being insidiously related knotted and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed things perhaps even in being essentially identical with them perhaps but who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous perhapses for that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of philosophers such as will have other tastes and inclinations the reverse of those hitherto prevalent philosophers of the dangerous perhaps in every sense of the term and to speak in all seriousness i see such new philosophers beginning to appear having kept a sharp eye on philosophers and having read between their lines long enough i now say to myself that the greater part of conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions and it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking one has here to learn anew as one learned anew about heredity and innateness as little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process and procedure of heredity just as little is being conscious opposed to the instinctive in any decisive sense the greater part of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his instincts and forced into definite channels and behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement there are valuations or to speak more plainly physiological demands for the maintenance of a definite mode of life for example that the certain is worth more than the uncertain that illusion is less valuable than truth such valuations in spite of their regulative importance for us might notwithstanding be only superficial valuations special kinds of niaiserie such as may be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves supposing in effect that man is not just the measure of things the falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it it is here perhaps that our new language sounds most strangely the question is how far an opinion is life furthering life preserving species preserving perhaps species rearing and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong are the most indispensable to us that without a recognition of logical fictions without a comparison of reality with the purely imagined world of the absolute and immutable without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers man could not live that the renunciation of false opinions would be a renunciation of life a negation of life to recognise untruth as a condition of life that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in a dangerous manner and a philosophy which ventures to do so has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil that which causes philosophers to be regarded half distrustfully and half mockingly is not the oft repeated discovery how innocent they are how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way in short how childish and childlike they are but that there is not enough honest dealing with them whereas they all raise a loud and virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in the remotest manner they all pose as though their real opinions had been discovered and attained through the self evolving of a cold pure divinely indifferent dialectic in contrast to all sorts of mystics who fairer and foolisher talk of inspiration whereas in fact a prejudiced proposition idea or suggestion which is generally their heart s desire abstracted and refined is defended by them with arguments sought out after the event they are all advocates who do not wish to be regarded as such generally astute defenders also of their prejudices which they dub truths and very far from having the conscience which bravely admits this to itself very far from having the good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this be understood perhaps to warn friend or foe or in cheerful confidence and self ridicule the spectacle of the tartuffery of old kant equally stiff and decent with which he entices us into the dialectic by ways that lead more correctly mislead to his categorical imperative makes us fastidious ones smile we who find no small amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical preachers or still more so the hocus pocus in mathematical form by means of which spinoza has as it were clad his philosophy in mail and mask in fact the love of his wisdom to translate the term fairly and squarely in order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible maiden that pallas athene how much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray it has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up till now has consisted of namely the confession of its originator and a species of involuntary and unconscious auto biography and moreover that the moral or immoral purpose in every philosophy has constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown indeed to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have been arrived at it is always well and wise to first ask oneself what morality do they or does he aim at accordingly i do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy but that another impulse here as elsewhere has only made use of knowledge and mistaken knowledge as an instrument but whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they may have here acted as inspiring genii or as demons and cobolds will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another and that each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate lord over all the other impulses for every impulse is imperious and as such attempts to philosophize to be sure in the case of scholars in the case of really scientific men it may be otherwise better if you will there there may really be such a thing as an impulse to knowledge some kind of small independent clock work which when well wound up works away industriously to that end without the rest of the scholarly impulses taking any material part therein the actual interests of the scholar therefore are generally in quite another direction in the family perhaps or in money making or in politics it is in fact almost indifferent at what point of research his little machine is placed and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good philologist a mushroom specialist or a chemist he is not characterised by becoming this or that in the philosopher on the contrary there is absolutely nothing impersonal and above all his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to who he is that is to say in what order the deepest impulses of his nature stand to each other how malicious philosophers can be i know of nothing more stinging than the joke epicurus took the liberty of making on plato and the platonists he called them dionysiokolakes in its original sense and on the face of it the word signifies flatterers of dionysius consequently tyrants accessories and lick spittles besides this however it is as much as to say they are all actors there is nothing genuine about them for dionysiokolax was a popular name for an actor and the latter is really the malignant reproach that epicurus cast upon plato he was annoyed by the grandiose manner the mise en scene style of which plato and his scholars were masters of which epicurus was not a master he the old school teacher of samos who sat concealed in his little garden at athens and wrote three hundred books perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of plato who knows greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden god epicurus really was did she ever find out there is a point in every philosophy at which the conviction of the philosopher appears on the scene or to put it in the words of an ancient mystery adventavit asinus pulcher et fortissimus you desire to live according to nature oh you noble stoics what fraud of words imagine to yourselves a being like nature boundlessly extravagant boundlessly indifferent without purpose or consideration without pity or justice at once fruitful and barren and uncertain imagine to yourselves indifference as a power how could you live in accordance with such indifference to live is not that just endeavouring to be otherwise than this nature is not living valuing preferring being unjust being limited endeavouring to be different and granted that your imperative living according to nature means actually the same as living according to life how could you do differently why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are and must be in reality however it is quite otherwise with you while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in nature you want something quite the contrary you extraordinary stage players and self deluders in your pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to nature to nature herself and to incorporate them therein you insist that it shall be nature according to the stoa and would like everything to be made after your own image as a vast eternal glorification and generalism of stoicism with all your love for truth you have forced yourselves so long so persistently and with such hypnotic rigidity to see nature falsely that is to say stoically that you are no longer able to see it otherwise and to crown all some unfathomable superciliousness gives you the bedlamite hope that because you are able to tyrannize over yourselves stoicism is self tyranny nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over is not the stoic a part of nature but this is an old and everlasting story what happened in old times with the stoics still happens today as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself it always creates the world in its own image it cannot do otherwise philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself the most spiritual will to power the will to creation of the world the will to the causa prima the eagerness and subtlety i should even say craftiness with which the problem of the real and the apparent world is dealt with at present throughout europe furnishes food for thought and attention and he who hears only a will to truth in the background and nothing else cannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears in rare and isolated cases it may really have happened that such a will to truth a certain extravagant and adventurous pluck a metaphysician s ambition of the forlorn hope has participated therein that which in the end always prefers a handful of certainty to a whole cartload of beautiful possibilities there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing rather than in an uncertain something but that is nihilism and the sign of a despairing mortally wearied soul notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a virtue may display it seems however to be otherwise with stronger and livelier thinkers who are still eager for life in that they side against appearance and speak superciliously of perspective in that they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the credibility of the ocular evidence that the earth stands still and thus apparently allowing with complacency their securest possession to escape for what does one at present believe in more firmly than in one s body who knows if they are not really trying to win back something which was formerly an even securer possession something of the old domain of the faith of former times perhaps the immortal soul perhaps the old god in short ideas by which they could live better that is to say more vigorously and more joyously than by modern ideas there is distrust of these modern ideas in this mode of looking at things a disbelief in all that has been constructed yesterday and today there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety and scorn which can no longer endure the bric a brac of ideas of the most varied origin such as so called positivism at present throws on the market a disgust of the more refined taste at the village fair motleyness and patchiness of all these reality philosophasters in whom there is nothing either new or true except this motleyness therein it seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti realists and knowledge microscopists of the present day their instinct which repels them from modern reality is unrefuted what do their retrograde by paths concern us the main thing about them is not that they wish to go back but that they wish to get away therefrom a little more strength swing courage and artistic power and they would be off and not back it seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to divert attention from the actual influence which kant exercised on german philosophy and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself kant was first and foremost proud of his table of categories with it in his hand he said this is the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics let us only understand this could be he was proud of having discovered a new faculty in man the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori granting that he deceived himself in this matter the development and rapid flourishing of german philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride and on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible something at all events new faculties of which to be still prouder but let us reflect for a moment it is high time to do so how are synthetic judgments a priori possible kant asks himself and what is really his answer by means of a means faculty but unfortunately not in five words but so circumstantially imposingly and with such display of german profundity and verbal flourishes that one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer people were beside themselves with delight over this new faculty and the jubilation reached its climax when kant further discovered a moral faculty in man for at that time germans were still moral not yet dabbling in the politics of hard fact then came the honeymoon of german philosophy all the young theologians of the tubingen institution went immediately into the groves all seeking for faculties and what did they not find in that innocent rich and still youthful period of the german spirit to which romanticism the malicious fairy piped and sang when one could not yet distinguish between finding and inventing above all a faculty for the transcendental schelling christened it intellectual intuition and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally pious inclined germans one can do no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement which was really youthfulness notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly in hoary and senile conceptions than to take it seriously or even treat it with moral indignation enough however the world grew older and the dream vanished a time came when people rubbed their foreheads and they still rub them today people had been dreaming and first and foremost old kant by means of a means faculty he had said or at least meant to say but is that an answer an explanation or is it not rather merely a repetition of the question how does opium induce sleep by means of a means faculty namely the virtus dormitiva replies the doctor in moliere quia est in eo virtus dormitiva cujus est natura sensus assoupire but such replies belong to the realm of comedy and it is high time to replace the kantian question how are synthetic judgments a priori possible by another question why is belief in such judgments necessary in effect it is high time that we should understand that such judgments must be believed to be true for the sake of the preservation of creatures like ourselves though they still might naturally be false judgments or more plainly spoken and roughly and readily synthetic judgments a priori should not be possible at all we have no right to them in our mouths they are nothing but false judgments only of course the belief in their truth is necessary as plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view of life and finally to call to mind the enormous influence which german philosophy i hope you understand its right to inverted commas goosefeet has exercised throughout the whole of europe there is no doubt that a certain virtus dormitiva had a share in it thanks to german philosophy it was a delight to the noble idlers the virtuous the mystics the artiste the three fourths christians and the political obscurantists of all nations to find an antidote to the still overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into this in short sensus assoupire as regards materialistic atomism it is one of the best refuted theories that have been advanced and in europe there is now perhaps no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it except for convenient everyday use as an abbreviation of the means of expression thanks chiefly to the pole boscovich he and the pole copernicus have hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponents of ocular evidence for while copernicus has persuaded us to believe contrary to all the senses that the earth does not stand fast boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that stood fast of the earth the belief in substance in matter in the earth residuum and particle atom it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth one must however go still further and also declare war relentless war to the knife against the atomistic requirements which still lead a dangerous after life in places where no one suspects them like the more celebrated metaphysical requirements one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which christianity has taught best and longest the soul atomism let it be permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the soul as something indestructible eternal indivisible as a monad as an atomon this belief ought to be expelled from science between ourselves it is not at all necessary to get rid of the soul thereby and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypotheses as happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists who can hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it but the way is open for new acceptations and refinements of the soul hypothesis and such conceptions as mortal soul and soul of subjective multiplicity and soul as social structure of the instincts and passions want henceforth to have legitimate rights in science in that the new psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of the soul he is really as it were thrusting himself into a new desert and a new distrust it is possible that the older psychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of it eventually however he finds that precisely thereby he is also condemned to invent and who knows perhaps to discover the new psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the instinct of self preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being a living thing seeks above all to discharge its strength life itself is will to power self preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent results thereof in short here as everywhere else let us beware of superfluous teleological principles one of which is the instinct of self preservation we owe it to spinoza s inconsistency it is thus in effect that method ordains which must be essentially economy of principles it is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural philosophy is only a world exposition and world arrangement according to us if i may say so and not a world explanation but in so far as it is based on belief in the senses it is regarded as more and for a long time to come must be regarded as more namely as an explanation it has eyes and fingers of its own it has ocular evidence and palpableness of its own this operates fascinatingly persuasively and convincingly upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes in fact it follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism what is clear what is explained only that which can be seen and felt one must pursue every problem thus far obversely however the charm of the platonic mode of thought which was an aristocratic mode consisted precisely in resistance to obvious sense evidence perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our contemporaries but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of them and this by means of pale cold grey conceptional networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses the mob of the senses as plato said in this overcoming of the world and interpreting of the world in the manner of plato there was an enjoyment different from that which the physicists of today offer us and likewise the darwinists and anti teleologists among the physiological workers with their principle of the smallest possible effort and the greatest possible blunder where there is nothing more to see or to grasp there is also nothing more for men to do that is certainly an imperative different from the platonic one but it may notwithstanding be the right imperative for a hardy laborious race of machinists and bridge builders of the future who have nothing but rough work to perform to study physiology with a clear conscience one must insist on the fact that the sense organs are not phenomena in the sense of the idealistic philosophy as such they certainly could not be causes sensualism therefore at least as regulative hypothesis if not as heuristic principle what and others say even that the external world is the work of our organs but then our body as a part of this external world would be the work of our organs but then our organs themselves would be the work of our organs it seems to me that this is a complete reductio ad absurdum if the conception causa sui is something fundamentally absurd consequently the external world is not the work of our organs there are still harmless self observers who believe that there are immediate certainties for instance i think or as the superstition of schopenhauer puts it i will as though cognition here got hold of its object purely and simply as the thing in itself without any falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the object i would repeat it however a hundred times that immediate certainty as well as absolute knowledge and the thing in itself involve a contradictio in adjecto we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words the people on their part may think that cognition is knowing all about things but the philosopher must say to himself when i analyze the process that is expressed in the sentence i think i find a whole series of daring assertions the argumentative proof of which would be difficult perhaps impossible for instance that it is i who think that there must necessarily be something that thinks that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause that there is an ego and finally that it is already determined what is to be designated by thinking that i know what thinking is for if i had not already decided within myself what it is by what standard could i determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps willing or feeling in short the assertion i think assumes that i compare my state at the present moment with other states of myself which i know in order to determine what it is on account of this retrospective connection with further knowledge it has at any rate no immediate certainty for me in place of the immediate certainty in which the people may believe in the special case the philosopher thus finds a series of metaphysical questions presented to him veritable conscience questions of the intellect to wit whence did i get the notion of thinking why do i believe in cause and effect what gives me the right to speak of an ego and even of an ego as cause and finally of an ego as cause of thought he who ventures to answer these metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a sort of intuitive perception like the person who says i think and know that this at least is true actual and certain will encounter a smile and two notes of interrogation in a philosopher nowadays sir the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand it is improbable that you are not mistaken but why should it be the truth with regard to the superstitions of logicians i shall never tire of emphasizing a small terse fact which is unwillingly recognized by these credulous minds namely that a thought comes when it wishes and not when i wish so that it is a perversion of the facts of the case to say that the subject i is the condition of the predicate think one thinks but that this one is precisely the famous old ego is to put it mildly only a supposition an assertion and assuredly not an immediate certainty after all one has even gone too far with this one thinks even the one contains an interpretation of the process and does not belong to the process itself one infers here according to the usual grammatical formula to think is an activity every activity requires an agency that is active consequently it was pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought besides the operating power the material particle wherein it resides and out of which it operates the atom more rigorous minds however learnt at last to get along without this earth residuum and perhaps some day we shall accustom ourselves even from the logician s point of view to get along without the little one to which the worthy old ego has refined itself it is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle minds it seems that the hundred times refuted theory of the free will owes its persistence to this charm alone some one is always appearing who feels himself strong enough to refute it philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were the best known thing in the world indeed schopenhauer has given us to understand that the will alone is really known to us absolutely and completely known without deduction or addition but it again and again seems to me that in this case schopenhauer also only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing he seems to have adopted a popular prejudice and exaggerated it willing seems to me to be above all something complicated something that is a unity only in name and it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks which has got the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages so let us for once be more cautious let us be unphilosophical let us say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations namely the sensation of the condition away from which we go the sensation of the condition towards which we go the sensation of this from and towards itself and then besides an accompanying muscular sensation which even without our putting in motion arms and legs commences its action by force of habit directly we will anything therefore just as sensations and indeed many kinds of sensations are to be recognized as ingredients of the will so in the second place thinking is also to be recognized in every act of the will there is a ruling thought and let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from the willing as if the will would then remain over in the third place the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking but it is above all an emotion and in fact the emotion of the command that which is termed freedom of the will is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey i am free he must obey this consciousness is inherent in every will and equally so the straining of the attention the straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing the unconditional judgment that this and nothing else is necessary now the inward certainty that obedience will be rendered and whatever else pertains to the position of the commander a man who wills commands something within himself which renders obedience or which he believes renders obedience but now let us notice what is the strangest thing about the will this affair so extremely complex for which the people have only one name inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding and the obeying parties and as the obeying party we know the sensations of constraint impulsion pressure resistance and motion which usually commence immediately after the act of will inasmuch as on the other hand we are accustomed to disregard this duality and to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term i a whole series of erroneous conclusions and consequently of false judgments about the will itself has become attached to the act of willing to such a degree that he who wills believes firmly that willing suffices for action since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will when the effect of the command consequently obedience and therefore action was to be expected the appearance has translated itself into the sentiment as if there were a necessity of effect in a word he who wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow one he ascribes the success the carrying out of the willing to the will itself and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success freedom of will that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order who as such enjoys also the triumph over obstacles but thinks within himself that it was really his own will that overcame them in this way the person exercising volition adds the feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments the useful underwills or under souls indeed our body is but a social structure composed of many souls to his feelings of delight as commander l effet c est moi what happens here is what happens in every well constructed and happy commonwealth namely that the governing class identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth in all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying on the basis as already said of a social structure composed of many souls on which account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing as such within the sphere of morals regarded as the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of life manifests itself that the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or autonomously evolving but grow up in connection and relationship with each other that however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought they nevertheless belong just as much to a system as the collective members of the fauna of a continent is betrayed in the end by the circumstance how unfailingly the most diverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme of possible philosophies under an invisible spell they always revolve once more in the same orbit however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills something within them leads them something impels them in definite order the one after the other to wit the innate methodology and relationship of their ideas their thinking is in fact far less a discovery than a re recognizing a remembering a return and a home coming to a far off ancient common household of the soul out of which those ideas formerly grew philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order the wonderful family resemblance of all indian greek and german philosophizing is easily enough explained in fact where there is affinity of language owing to the common philosophy of grammar i mean owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical functions it cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset for a similar development and succession of philosophical systems just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of world interpretation it is highly probable that philosophers within the domain of the ural altaic languages where the conception of the subject is least developed look otherwise into the world and will be found on paths of thought different from those of the indo germans and mussulmans the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately also the spell of physiological valuations and racial conditions so much by way of rejecting locke s superficiality with regard to the origin of ideas the causa sui is the best self contradiction that has yet been conceived it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness but the extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with this very folly the desire for freedom of will in the superlative metaphysical sense such as still holds sway unfortunately in the minds of the half educated the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one s actions oneself and to absolve god the world ancestors chance and society therefrom involves nothing less than to be precisely this causa sui and with more than munchausen daring to pull oneself up into existence by the hair out of the slough of nothingness if any one should find out in this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of free will and put it out of his head altogether i beg of him to carry his enlightenment a step further and also put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception of free will i mean non free will which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect one should not wrongly materialise cause and effect as the natural philosophers do and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at present according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it effects its end one should use cause and effect only as pure conceptions that is to say as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual understanding not for explanation in being in itself there is nothing of casual connection of necessity or of psychological non freedom there the effect does not follow the cause there law does not obtain it is we alone who have devised cause sequence reciprocity relativity constraint number law freedom motive and purpose and when we interpret and intermix this symbol world as being in itself with things we act once more as we have always acted mythologically the non free will is mythology in real life it is only a question of strong and weak wills it is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker in every causal connection and psychological necessity manifests something of compulsion indigence obsequiousness oppression and non freedom it is suspicious to have such feelings the person betrays himself and in general if i have observed correctly the non freedom of the will is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints but always in a profoundly personal manner some will not give up their responsibility their belief in themselves the personal right to their merits at any price the vain races belong to this class others on the contrary do not wish to be answerable for anything or blamed for anything and owing to an inward self contempt seek to get out of the business no matter how the latter when they write books are in the habit at present of taking the side of criminals a sort of socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise and as a matter of fact the fatalism of the weak willed embellishes itself surprisingly when it can pose as la religion de la souffrance humaine that is its good taste let me be pardoned as an old philologist who cannot desist from the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation but nature s conformity to law of which you physicists talk so proudly as though why it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad philology it is no matter of fact no text but rather just a naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning with which you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern soul everywhere equality before the law nature is not different in that respect nor better than we a fine instance of secret motive in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and autocratic likewise a second and more refined atheism is once more disguised ni dieu ni maitre that also is what you want and therefore cheers for natural law is it not so but as has been said that is interpretation not text and somebody might come along who with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation could read out of the same nature and with regard to the same phenomena just the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims of power an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and unconditionalness of all will to power before your eyes that almost every word and the word tyranny itself would eventually seem unsuitable or like a weakening and softening metaphor as being too human and who should nevertheless end by asserting the same about this world as you do namely that it has a necessary and calculable course not however because laws obtain in it but because they are absolutely lacking and every power effects its ultimate consequences every moment granted that this also is only interpretation and you will be eager enough to make this objection well so much the better all psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and timidities it has not dared to launch out into the depths in so far as it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent it seems as if nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the morphology and development doctrine of the will to power as i conceive of it the power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most intellectual world the world apparently most indifferent and unprejudiced and has obviously operated in an injurious obstructive blinding and distorting manner a proper physio psychology has to contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator it has the heart against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal conditionalness of the good and the bad impulses causes as refined immorality distress and aversion in a still strong and manly conscience still more so a doctrine of the derivation of all good impulses from bad ones if however a person should regard even the emotions of hatred envy covetousness and imperiousness as life conditioning emotions as factors which must be present fundamentally and essentially in the general economy of life which must therefore be further developed if life is to be further developed he will suffer from such a view of things as from sea sickness and yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous knowledge and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one should keep away from it who can do so on the other hand if one has once drifted hither with one s bark well very good now let us set our teeth firmly let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm we sail away right over morality we crush out we destroy perhaps the remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither but what do we matter never yet did a profounder world of insight reveal itself to daring travelers and adventurers and the psychologist who thus makes a sacrifice it is not the sacrifizio dell intelletto on the contrary will at least be entitled to demand in return that psychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciences for whose service and equipment the other sciences exist for psychology is once more the path to the fundamental problems chapter ii the free spirit o sancta simplicitiatas in what strange simplification and falsification man lives one can never cease wondering when once one has got eyes for beholding this marvel how we have made everything around us clear and free and easy and simple how we have been able to give our senses a passport to everything superficial our thoughts a godlike desire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences how from the beginning we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost inconceivable freedom thoughtlessness imprudence heartiness and gaiety in order to enjoy life and only on this solidified granite like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself hitherto the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful will the will to ignorance to the uncertain to the untrue not as its opposite but as its refinement it is to be hoped indeed that language here as elsewhere will not get over its awkwardness and that it will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees and many refinements of gradation it is equally to be hoped that the incarnated tartuffery of morals which now belongs to our unconquerable flesh and blood will turn the words round in the mouths of us discerning ones here and there we understand it and laugh at the way in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this simplified thoroughly artificial suitably imagined and suitably falsified world at the way in which whether it will or not it loves error because as living itself it loves life after such a cheerful commencement a serious word would fain be heard it appeals to the most serious minds take care ye philosophers and friends of knowledge and beware of martyrdom of suffering for the truth s sake even in your own defense it spoils all the innocence and fine neutrality of your conscience it makes you headstrong against objections and red rags it stupefies animalizes and brutalizes when in the struggle with danger slander suspicion expulsion and even worse consequences of enmity ye have at last to play your last card as protectors of truth upon earth as though the truth were such an innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors and you of all people ye knights of the sorrowful countenance messrs loafers and cobweb spinners of the spirit finally ye know sufficiently well that it cannot be of any consequence if ye just carry your point ye know that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point and that there might be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines and occasionally after yourselves than in all the solemn pantomime and trumping games before accusers and law courts rather go out of the way flee into concealment and have your masks and your ruses that ye may be mistaken for what you are or somewhat feared and pray don t forget the garden the garden with golden trellis work and have people around you who are as a garden or as music on the waters at eventide when already the day becomes a memory choose the good solitude the free wanton lightsome solitude which also gives you the right still to remain good in any sense whatsoever how poisonous how crafty how bad does every long war make one which cannot be waged openly by means of force how personal does a long fear make one a long watching of enemies of possible enemies these pariahs of society these long pursued badly persecuted ones also the compulsory recluses the spinozas or giordano brunos always become in the end even under the most intellectual masquerade and perhaps without being themselves aware of it refined vengeance seekers and poison brewers just lay bare the foundation of spinoza s ethics and theology not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him the martyrdom of the philosopher his sacrifice for the sake of truth forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous desire to see him also in his deterioration deteriorated into a martyr into a stage and tribune bawler only that it is necessary with such a desire to be clear what spectacle one will see in any case merely a satyric play merely an epilogue farce merely the continued proof that the long real tragedy is at an end supposing that every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy where he is free from the crowd the many the majority where he may forget men who are the rule as their exception exclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense whoever in intercourse with men does not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours of distress owing to disgust satiety sympathy gloominess and solitariness is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes supposing however that he does not voluntarily take all this burden and disgust upon himself that he persistently avoids it and remains as i said quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel one thing is then certain he was not made he was not predestined for knowledge for as such he would one day have to say to himself the devil take my good taste but the rule is more interesting than the exception than myself the exception and he would go down and above all he would go inside the long and serious study of the average man and consequently much disguise self overcoming familiarity and bad intercourse all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one s equals that constitutes a necessary part of the life history of every philosopher perhaps the most disagreeable odious and disappointing part if he is fortunate however as a favourite child of knowledge should be he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and lighten his task i mean so called cynics those who simply recognize the animal the commonplace and the rule in themselves and at the same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them talk of themselves and their like before witnesses sometimes they wallow even in books as on their own dung hill cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach what is called honesty and the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him or the scientific satyr speaks out there are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgust namely where by a freak of nature genius is bound to some such indiscreet billy goat and ape as in the case of the abbe galiani the profoundest acutest and perhaps also filthiest man of his century he was far profounder than voltaire and consequently also a good deal more silent it happens more frequently as has been hinted that a scientific head is placed on an ape s body a fine exceptional understanding in a base soul an occurrence by no means rare especially among doctors and moral physiologists and whenever anyone speaks without bitterness or rather quite innocently of man as a belly with two requirements and a head with one whenever any one sees seeks and wants to see only hunger sexual instinct and vanity as the real and only motives of human actions in short when any one speaks badly and not even ill of man then ought the lover of knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently he ought in general to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation for the indignant man and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with his own teeth or in place of himself the world god or society may indeed morally speaking stand higher than the laughing and self satisfied satyr but in every other sense he is the more ordinary more indifferent and less instructive case and no one is such a liar as the indignant man it is difficult to be understood especially when one thinks and lives gangasrotogati footnote like the river ganges presto among those only who think and live otherwise namely kurmagati footnote like the tortoise lento or at best froglike mandeikagati footnote like the frog staccato i do everything to be difficultly understood myself and one should be heartily grateful for the good will to some refinement of interpretation as regards the good friends however who are always too easy going and think that as friends they have a right to ease one does well at the very first to grant them a play ground and romping place for misunderstanding one can thus laugh still or get rid of them altogether these good friends and laugh then also what is most difficult to render from one language into another is the tempo of its style which has its basis in the character of the race or to speak more physiologically in the average tempo of the assimilation of its nutriment there are honestly meant translations which as involuntary vulgarizations are almost falsifications of the original merely because its lively and merry tempo which overleaps and obviates all dangers in word and expression could not also be rendered a german is almost incapacitated for presto in his language consequently also as may be reasonably inferred for many of the most delightful and daring nuances of free free spirited thought and just as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience so aristophanes and petronius are untranslatable for him everything ponderous viscous and pompously clumsy all long winded and wearying species of style are developed in profuse variety among germans pardon me for stating the fact that even goethe s prose in its mixture of stiffness and elegance is no exception as a reflection of the good old time to which it belongs and as an expression of german taste at a time when there was still a german taste which was a rococo taste in moribus et artibus lessing is an exception owing to his histrionic nature which understood much and was versed in many things he who was not the translator of bayle to no purpose who took refuge willingly in the shadow of diderot and voltaire and still more willingly among the roman comedy writers lessing loved also free spiritism in the tempo and flight out of germany but how could the german language even in the prose of lessing imitate the tempo of machiavelli who in his principe makes us breathe the dry fine air of florence and cannot help presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimo perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he ventures to present long heavy difficult dangerous thoughts and a tempo of the gallop and of the best wantonest humour finally who would venture on a german translation of petronius who more than any great musician hitherto was a master of presto in invention ideas and words what matter in the end about the swamps of the sick evil world or of the ancient world when like him one has the feet of a wind the rush the breath the emancipating scorn of a wind which makes everything healthy by making everything run and with regard to aristophanes that transfiguring complementary genius for whose sake one pardons all hellenism for having existed provided one has understood in its full profundity all that there requires pardon and transfiguration there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on plato s secrecy and sphinx like nature than the happily preserved petit fait that under the pillow of his death bed there was found no bible nor anything egyptian pythagorean or platonic but a book of aristophanes how could even plato have endured life a greek life which he repudiated without an aristophanes it is the business of the very few to be independent it is a privilege of the strong and whoever attempts it even with the best right but without being obliged to do so proves that he is probably not only strong but also daring beyond measure he enters into a labyrinth he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already brings with it not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way becomes isolated and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience supposing such a one comes to grief it is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it nor sympathize with it and he cannot any longer go back he cannot even go back again to the sympathy of men our deepest insights must and should appear as follies and under certain circumstances as crimes when they come unauthorizedly to the ears of those who are not disposed and predestined for them the exoteric and the esoteric as they were formerly distinguished by philosophers among the indians as among the greeks persians and mussulmans in short wherever people believed in gradations of rank and not in equality and equal rights are not so much in contradistinction to one another in respect to the exoteric class standing without and viewing estimating measuring and judging from the outside and not from the inside the more essential distinction is that the class in question views things from below upwards while the esoteric class views things from above downwards there are heights of the soul from which tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically and if all the woe in the world were taken together who would dare to decide whether the sight of it would necessarily seduce and constrain to sympathy and thus to a doubling of the woe that which serves the higher class of men for nourishment or refreshment must be almost poison to an entirely different and lower order of human beings the virtues of the common man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher it might be possible for a highly developed man supposing him to degenerate and go to ruin to acquire qualities thereby alone for the sake of which he would have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he had sunk there are books which have an inverse value for the soul and the health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality or the higher and more powerful make use of them in the former case they are dangerous disturbing unsettling books in the latter case they are herald calls which summon the bravest to their bravery books for the general reader are always ill smelling books the odour of paltry people clings to them where the populace eat and drink and even where they reverence it is accustomed to stink one should not go into churches if one wishes to breathe pure air in our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art of nuance which is the best gain of life and we have rightly to do hard penance for having fallen upon men and things with yea and nay everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes the taste for the unconditional is cruelly befooled and abused until a man learns to introduce a little art into his sentiments and prefers to try conclusions with the artificial as do the real artists of life the angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no peace until it has suitably falsified men and things to be able to vent its passion upon them youth in itself even is something falsifying and deceptive later on when the young soul tortured by continual disillusions finally turns suspiciously against itself still ardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience how it upbraids itself how impatiently it tears itself how it revenges itself for its long self blinding as though it had been a voluntary blindness in this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one s sentiments one tortures one s enthusiasm with doubt one feels even the good conscience to be a danger as if it were the self concealment and lassitude of a more refined uprightness and above all one espouses upon principle the cause against youth a decade later and one comprehends that all this was also still youth throughout the longest period of human history one calls it the prehistoric period the value or non value of an action was inferred from its consequences the action in itself was not taken into consideration any more than its origin but pretty much as in china at present where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to its parents the retro operating power of success or failure was what induced men to think well or ill of an action let us call this period the pre moral period of mankind the imperative know thyself was then still unknown in the last ten thousand years on the other hand on certain large portions of the earth one has gradually got so far that one no longer lets the consequences of an action but its origin decide with regard to its worth a great achievement as a whole an important refinement of vision and of criterion the unconscious effect of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in origin the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as the moral one the first attempt at self knowledge is thereby made instead of the consequences the origin what an inversion of perspective and assuredly an inversion effected only after long struggle and wavering to be sure an ominous new superstition a peculiar narrowness of interpretation attained supremacy precisely thereby the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite sense possible as origin out of an intention people were agreed in the belief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention the intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been bestowed and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the present day is it not possible however that the necessity may now have arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversing and fundamental shifting of values owing to a new self consciousness and acuteness in man is it not possible that we may be standing on the threshold of a period which to begin with would be distinguished negatively as ultra moral nowadays when at least among us immoralists the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely in that which is not intentional and that all its intentionalness all that is seen sensible or sensed in it belongs to its surface or skin which like every skin betrays something but conceals still more in short we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom which first requires an explanation a sign moreover which has too many interpretations and consequently hardly any meaning in itself alone that morality in the sense in which it has been understood hitherto as intention morality has been a prejudice perhaps a prematureness or preliminariness probably something of the same rank as astrology and alchemy but in any case something which must be surmounted the surmounting of morality in a certain sense even the self mounting of morality let that be the name for the long secret labour which has been reserved for the most refined the most upright and also the most wicked consciences of today as the living touchstones of the soul it cannot be helped the sentiment of surrender of sacrifice for one s neighbour and all self renunciation morality must be mercilessly called to account and brought to judgment just as the aesthetics of disinterested contemplation under which the emasculation of art nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience there is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments for others and not for myself for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here and for one asking promptly are they not perhaps deceptions that they please him who has them and him who enjoys their fruit and also the mere spectator that is still no argument in their favour but just calls for caution let us therefore be cautious at whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays seen from every position the erroneousness of the world in which we think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light upon we find proof after proof thereof which would fain allure us into surmises concerning a deceptive principle in the nature of things he however who makes thinking itself and consequently the spirit responsible for the falseness of the world an honourable exit which every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of he who regards this world including space time form and movement as falsely deduced would have at least good reason in the end to become distrustful also of all thinking has it not hitherto been playing upon us the worst of scurvy tricks and what guarantee would it give that it would not continue to do what it has always been doing in all seriousness the innocence of thinkers has something touching and respect inspiring in it which even nowadays permits them to wait upon consciousness with the request that it will give them honest answers for example whether it be real or not and why it keeps the outer world so resolutely at a distance and other questions of the same description the belief in immediate certainties is a moral naivete which does honour to us philosophers but we have now to cease being merely moral men apart from morality such belief is a folly which does little honour to us if in middle class life an ever ready distrust is regarded as the sign of a bad character and consequently as an imprudence here among us beyond the middle class world and its yeas and nays what should prevent our being imprudent and saying the philosopher has at length a right to bad character as the being who has hitherto been most befooled on earth he is now under obligation to distrustfulness to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of suspicion forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of expression for i myself have long ago learned to think and estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived and i keep at least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with which philosophers struggle against being deceived why not it is nothing more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance it is in fact the worst proved supposition in the world so much must be conceded there could have been no life at all except upon the basis of perspective estimates and semblances and if with the virtuous enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers one wished to do away altogether with the seeming world well granted that you could do that at least nothing of your truth would thereby remain indeed what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an essential opposition of true and false is it not enough to suppose degrees of seemingness and as it were lighter and darker shades and tones of semblance different valeurs as the painters say why might not the world which concerns us be a fiction and to any one who suggested but to a fiction belongs an originator might it not be bluntly replied why may not this belong also belong to the fiction is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the subject just as towards the predicate and object might not the philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar all respect to governesses but is it not time that philosophy should renounce governess faith o voltaire o humanity o idiocy there is something ticklish in the truth and in the search for the truth and if man goes about it too humanely il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien i wager he finds nothing supposing that nothing else is given as real but our world of desires and passions that we cannot sink or rise to any other reality but just that of our impulses for thinking is only a relation of these impulses to one another are we not permitted to make the attempt and to ask the question whether this which is given does not suffice by means of our counterparts for the understanding even of the so called mechanical or material world i do not mean as an illusion a semblance a representation in the berkeleyan and schopenhauerian sense but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions themselves as a more primitive form of the world of emotions in which everything still lies locked in a mighty unity which afterwards branches off and develops itself in organic processes naturally also refines and debilitates as a kind of instinctive life in which all organic functions including self regulation assimilation nutrition secretion and change of matter are still synthetically united with one another as a primary form of life in the end it is not only permitted to make this attempt it is commanded by the conscience of logical method not to assume several kinds of causality so long as the attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its furthest extent to absurdity if i may be allowed to say so that is a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadays it follows from its definition as mathematicians say the question is ultimately whether we really recognize the will as operating whether we believe in the causality of the will if we do so and fundamentally our belief in this is just our belief in causality itself we must make the attempt to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality will can naturally only operate on will and not on matter not on nerves for instance in short the hypothesis must be hazarded whether will does not operate on will wherever effects are recognized and whether all mechanical action inasmuch as a power operates therein is not just the power of will the effect of will granted finally that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one fundamental form of will namely the will to power as my thesis puts it granted that all organic functions could be traced back to this will to power and that the solution of the problem of generation and nutrition it is one problem could also be found therein one would thus have acquired the right to define all active force unequivocally as will to power the world seen from within the world defined and designated according to its intelligible character it would simply be will to power and nothing else what does not that mean in popular language god is disproved but not the devil on the contrary on the contrary my friends and who the devil also compels you to speak popularly as happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times with the french revolution that terrible farce quite superfluous when judged close at hand into which however the noble and visionary spectators of all europe have interpreted from a distance their own indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately until the text has disappeared under the interpretation so a noble posterity might once more misunderstand the whole of the past and perhaps only thereby make its aspect endurable or rather has not this already happened have not we ourselves been that noble posterity and in so far as we now comprehend this is it not thereby already past nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely because it makes people happy or virtuous excepting perhaps the amiable idealists who are enthusiastic about the good true and beautiful and let all kinds of motley coarse and good natured desirabilities swim about promiscuously in their pond happiness and virtue are no arguments it is willingly forgotten however even on the part of thoughtful minds that to make unhappy and to make bad are just as little counter arguments a thing could be true although it were in the highest degree injurious and dangerous indeed the fundamental constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full knowledge of it so that the strength of a mind might be measured by the amount of truth it could endure or to speak more plainly by the extent to which it required truth attenuated veiled sweetened damped and falsified but there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain portions of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably situated and have a greater likelihood of success not to speak of the wicked who are happy a species about whom moralists are silent perhaps severity and craft are more favourable conditions for the development of strong independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle refined yielding good nature and habit of taking things easily which are prized and rightly prized in a learned man presupposing always to begin with that the term philosopher be not confined to the philosopher who writes books or even introduces his philosophy into books stendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of the free spirited philosopher which for the sake of german taste i will not omit to underline for it is opposed to german taste pour etre bon philosophe says this last great psychologist il faut etre sec clair sans illusion un banquier qui a fait fortune a une partie du caractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie c est a dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est everything that is profound loves the mask the profoundest things have a hatred even of figure and likeness should not the contrary only be the right disguise for the shame of a god to go about in a question worth asking it would be strange if some mystic has not already ventured on the same kind of thing there are proceedings of such a delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness and make them unrecognizable there are actions of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take a stick and thrash the witness soundly one thereby obscures his recollection many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory in order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret shame is inventive they are not the worst things of which one is most ashamed there is not only deceit behind a mask there is so much goodness in craft i could imagine that a man with something costly and fragile to conceal would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like an old green heavily hooped wine cask the refinement of his shame requiring it to be so a man who has depths in his shame meets his destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate friends may be ignorant his mortal danger conceals itself from their eyes and equally so his regained security such a hidden nature which instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment and is inexhaustible in evasion of communication desires and insists that a mask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his friends and supposing he does not desire it his eyes will some day be opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there and that it is well to be so every profound spirit needs a mask nay more around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask owing to the constantly false that is to say superficial interpretation of every word he utters every step he takes every sign of life he manifests one must subject oneself to one s own tests that one is destined for independence and command and do so at the right time one must not avoid one s tests although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous game one can play and are in the end tests made only before ourselves and before no other judge not to cleave to any person be it even the dearest every person is a prison and also a recess not to cleave to a fatherland be it even the most suffering and necessitous it is even less difficult to detach one s heart from a victorious fatherland not to cleave to a sympathy be it even for higher men into whose peculiar torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight not to cleave to a science though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveries apparently specially reserved for us not to cleave to one s own liberation to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird which always flies further aloft in order always to see more under it the danger of the flier not to cleave to our own virtues nor become as a whole a victim to any of our specialties to our hospitality for instance which is the danger of dangers for highly developed and wealthy souls who deal prodigally almost indifferently with themselves and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes a vice one must know how to conserve oneself the best test of independence a new order of philosophers is appearing i shall venture to baptize them by a name not without danger as far as i understand them as far as they allow themselves to be understood for it is their nature to wish to remain something of a puzzle these philosophers of the future might rightly perhaps also wrongly claim to be designated as tempters this name itself is after all only an attempt or if it be preferred a temptation will they be new friends of truth these coming philosophers very probably for all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths but assuredly they will not be dogmatists it must be contrary to their pride and also contrary to their taste that their truth should still be truth for every one that which has hitherto been the secret wish and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts my opinion is my opinion another person has not easily a right to it such a philosopher of the future will say perhaps one must renounce the bad taste of wishing to agree with many people good is no longer good when one s neighbour takes it into his mouth and how could there be a common good the expression contradicts itself that which can be common is always of small value in the end things must be as they are and have always been the great things remain for the great the abysses for the profound the delicacies and thrills for the refined and to sum up shortly everything rare for the rare need i say expressly after all this that they will be free very free spirits these philosophers of the future as certainly also they will not be merely free spirits but something more higher greater and fundamentally different which does not wish to be misunderstood and mistaken but while i say this i feel under obligation almost as much to them as to ourselves we free spirits who are their heralds and forerunners to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old prejudice and misunderstanding which like a fog has too long made the conception of free spirit obscure in every country of europe and the same in america there is at present something which makes an abuse of this name a very narrow prepossessed enchained class of spirits who desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts prompt not to mention that in respect to the new philosophers who are appearing they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors briefly and regrettably they belong to the levellers these wrongly named free spirits as glib tongued and scribe fingered slaves of the democratic taste and its modern ideas all of them men without solitude without personal solitude blunt honest fellows to whom neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied only they are not free and are ludicrously superficial especially in their innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost all human misery and failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existed a notion which happily inverts the truth entirely what they would fain attain with all their strength is the universal green meadow happiness of the herd together with security safety comfort and alleviation of life for every one their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrines are called equality of rights and sympathy with all sufferers and suffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must be done away with we opposite ones however who have opened our eye and conscience to the question how and where the plant man has hitherto grown most vigorously believe that this has always taken place under the opposite conditions that for this end the dangerousness of his situation had to be increased enormously his inventive faculty and dissembling power his spirit had to develop into subtlety and daring under long oppression and compulsion and his will to life had to be increased to the unconditioned will to power we believe that severity violence slavery danger in the street and in the heart secrecy stoicism tempter s art and devilry of every kind that everything wicked terrible tyrannical predatory and serpentine in man serves as well for the elevation of the human species as its opposite we do not even say enough when we only say this much and in any case we find ourselves here both with our speech and our silence at the other extreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability as their antipodes perhaps what wonder that we free spirits are not exactly the most communicative spirits that we do not wish to betray in every respect what a spirit can free itself from and where perhaps it will then be driven and as to the import of the dangerous formula beyond good and evil with which we at least avoid confusion we are something else than libres penseurs liben pensatori free thinkers and whatever these honest advocates of modern ideas like to call themselves having been at home or at least guests in many realms of the spirit having escaped again and again from the gloomy agreeable nooks in which preferences and prejudices youth origin the accident of men and books or even the weariness of travel seemed to confine us full of malice against the seductions of dependency which he concealed in honours money positions or exaltation of the senses grateful even for distress and the vicissitudes of illness because they always free us from some rule and its prejudice grateful to the god devil sheep and worm in us inquisitive to a fault investigators to the point of cruelty with unhesitating fingers for the intangible with teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible ready for any business that requires sagacity and acute senses ready for every adventure owing to an excess of free will with anterior and posterior souls into the ultimate intentions of which it is difficult to pry with foregrounds and backgrounds to the end of which no foot may run hidden ones under the mantles of light appropriators although we resemble heirs and spendthrifts arrangers and collectors from morning till night misers of our wealth and our full crammed drawers economical in learning and forgetting inventive in scheming sometimes proud of tables of categories sometimes pedants sometimes night owls of work even in full day yea if necessary even scarecrows and it is necessary nowadays that is to say inasmuch as we are the born sworn jealous friends of solitude of our own profoundest midnight and midday solitude such kind of men are we we free spirits and perhaps ye are also something of the same kind ye coming ones ye new philosophers chapter iii the religious mood the human soul and its limits the range of man s inner experiences hitherto attained the heights depths and distances of these experiences the entire history of the soul up to the present time and its still unexhausted possibilities this is the preordained hunting domain for a born psychologist and lover of a big hunt but how often must he say despairingly to himself a single individual alas only a single individual and this great forest this virgin forest so he would like to have some hundreds of hunting assistants and fine trained hounds that he could send into the history of the human soul to drive his game together in vain again and again he experiences profoundly and bitterly how difficult it is to find assistants and dogs for all the things that directly excite his curiosity the evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous hunting domains where courage sagacity and subtlety in every sense are required is that they are no longer serviceable just when the big hunt and also the great danger commences it is precisely then that they lose their keen eye and nose in order for instance to divine and determine what sort of history the problem of knowledge and conscience has hitherto had in the souls of homines religiosi a person would perhaps himself have to possess as profound as bruised as immense an experience as the intellectual conscience of pascal and then he would still require that wide spread heaven of clear wicked spirituality which from above would be able to oversee arrange and effectively formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiences but who could do me this service and who would have time to wait for such servants they evidently appear too rarely they are so improbable at all times eventually one must do everything oneself in order to know something which means that one has much to do but a curiosity like mine is once for all the most agreeable of vices pardon me i mean to say that the love of truth has its reward in heaven and already upon earth faith such as early christianity desired and not infrequently achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly free spirited world which had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behind it and in it counting besides the education in tolerance which the imperium romanum gave this faith is not that sincere austere slave faith by which perhaps a luther or a cromwell or some other northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his god and christianity it is much rather the faith of pascal which resembles in a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reason a tough long lived worm like reason which is not to be slain at once and with a single blow the christian faith from the beginning is sacrifice the sacrifice of all freedom all pride all self confidence of spirit it is at the same time subjection self derision and self mutilation there is cruelty and religious phoenicianism in this faith which is adapted to a tender many sided and very fastidious conscience it takes for granted that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably painful that all the past and all the habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum in the form of which faith comes to it modern men with their obtuseness as regards all christian nomenclature have no longer the sense for the terribly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste by the paradox of the formula god on the cross hitherto there had never and nowhere been such boldness in inversion nor anything at once so dreadful questioning and questionable as this formula it promised a transvaluation of all ancient values it was the orient the profound orient it was the oriental slave who thus took revenge on rome and its noble light minded toleration on the roman catholicism of non faith and it was always not the faith but the freedom from the faith the half stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith which made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt against them enlightenment causes revolt for the slave desires the unconditioned he understands nothing but the tyrannous even in morals he loves as he hates without nuance to the very depths to the point of pain to the point of sickness his many hidden sufferings make him revolt against the noble taste which seems to deny suffering the skepticism with regard to suffering fundamentally only an attitude of aristocratic morality was not the least of the causes also of the last great slave insurrection which began with the french revolution wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so far we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen solitude fasting and sexual abstinence but without its being possible to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect or if any relation at all of cause and effect exists there this latter doubt is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among savage as well as among civilized peoples is the most sudden and excessive sensuality which then with equal suddenness transforms into penitential paroxysms world renunciation and will renunciation both symptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy but nowhere is it more obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has there grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition no other type seems to have been more interesting to men and even to philosophers perhaps it is time to become just a little indifferent here to learn caution or better still to look away to go away yet in the background of the most recent philosophy that of schopenhauer we find almost as the problem in itself this terrible note of interrogation of the religious crisis and awakening how is the negation of will possible how is the saint possible that seems to have been the very question with which schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher and thus it was a genuine schopenhauerian consequence that his most convinced adherent perhaps also his last as far as germany is concerned namely richard wagner should bring his own life work to an end just here and should finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage as kundry type vecu and as it loved and lived at the very time that the mad doctors in almost all european countries had an opportunity to study the type close at hand wherever the religious neurosis or as i call it the religious mood made its latest epidemical outbreak and display as the salvation army if it be a question however as to what has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages and even to philosophers in the whole phenomenon of the saint it is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein namely the immediate succession of opposites of states of the soul regarded as morally antithetical it was believed here to be self evident that a bad man was all at once turned into a saint a good man the hitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point is it not possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed itself under the dominion of morals because it believed in oppositions of moral values and saw read and interpreted these oppositions into the text and facts of the case what miracle only an error of interpretation a lack of philology it seems that the latin races are far more deeply attached to their catholicism than we northerners are to christianity generally and that consequently unbelief in catholic countries means something quite different from what it does among protestants namely a sort of revolt against the spirit of the race while with us it is rather a return to the spirit or non spirit of the race we northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races even as regards our talents for religion we have poor talents for it one may make an exception in the case of the celts who have theretofore furnished also the best soil for christian infection in the north the christian ideal blossomed forth in france as much as ever the pale sun of the north would allow it how strangely pious for our taste are still these later french skeptics whenever there is any celtic blood in their origin how catholic how un german does auguste comte s sociology seem to us with the roman logic of its instincts how jesuitical that amiable and shrewd cicerone of port royal sainte beuve in spite of all his hostility to jesuits and even ernest renan how inaccessible to us northerners does the language of such a renan appear in whom every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throws his refined voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off its balance let us repeat after him these fine sentences and what wickedness and haughtiness is immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less beautiful but harder souls that is to say in our more german souls disons donc hardiment que la religion est un produit de l homme normal que l homme est le plus dans le vrai quant il est le plus religieux et le plus assure d une destinee infinie c est quand il est bon qu il veut que la virtu corresponde a un order eternal c est quand il contemple les choses d une maniere desinteressee qu il trouve la mort revoltante et absurde comment ne pas supposer que c est dans ces moments la que l homme voit le mieux these sentences are so extremely antipodal to my ears and habits of thought that in my first impulse of rage on finding them i wrote on the margin la niaiserie religieuse par excellence until in my later rage i even took a fancy to them these sentences with their truth absolutely inverted it is so nice and such a distinction to have one s own antipodes that which is so astonishing in the religious life of the ancient greeks is the irrestrainable stream of gratitude which it pours forth it is a very superior kind of man who takes such an attitude towards nature and life later on when the populace got the upper hand in greece fear became rampant also in religion and christianity was preparing itself the passion for god there are churlish honest hearted and importunate kinds of it like that of luther the whole of protestantism lacks the southern delicatezza there is an oriental exaltation of the mind in it like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave as in the case of st augustine for instance who lacks in an offensive manner all nobility in bearing and desires there is a feminine tenderness and sensuality in it which modestly and unconsciously longs for a unio mystica et physica as in the case of madame de guyon in many cases it appears curiously enough as the disguise of a girl s or youth s puberty here and there even as the hysteria of an old maid also as her last ambition the church has frequently canonized the woman in such a case the mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before the saint as the enigma of self subjugation and utter voluntary privation why did they thus bow they divined in him and as it were behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearance the superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation the strength of will in which they recognized their own strength and love of power and knew how to honour it they honoured something in themselves when they honoured the saint in addition to this the contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion such an enormity of self negation and anti naturalness will not have been coveted for nothing they have said inquiringly there is perhaps a reason for it some very great danger about which the ascetic might wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors and visitors in a word the mighty ones of the world learned to have a new fear before him they divined a new power a strange still unconquered enemy it was the will to power which obliged them to halt before the saint they had to question him in the jewish old testament the book of divine justice there are men things and sayings on such an immense scale that greek and indian literature has nothing to compare with it one stands with fear and reverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly and one has sad thoughts about old asia and its little out pushed peninsula europe which would like by all means to figure before asia as the progress of mankind to be sure he who is himself only a slender tame house animal and knows only the wants of a house animal like our cultured people of today including the christians of cultured christianity need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins the taste for the old testament is a touchstone with respect to great and small perhaps he will find that the new testament the book of grace still appeals more to his heart there is much of the odour of the genuine tender stupid beadsman and petty soul in it to have bound up this new testament a kind of rococo of taste in every respect along with the old testament into one book as the bible as the book in itself is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the spirit which literary europe has upon its conscience why atheism nowadays the father in god is thoroughly refuted equally so the judge the rewarder also his free will he does not hear and even if he did he would not know how to help the worst is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly is he uncertain this is what i have made out by questioning and listening at a variety of conversations to be the cause of the decline of european theism it appears to me that though the religious instinct is in vigorous growth it rejects the theistic satisfaction with profound distrust what does all modern philosophy mainly do since descartes and indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure an attentat has been made on the part of all philosophers on the old conception of the soul under the guise of a criticism of the subject and predicate conception that is to say an attentat on the fundamental presupposition of christian doctrine modern philosophy as epistemological skepticism is secretly or openly anti christian although for keener ears be it said by no means anti religious formerly in effect one believed in the soul as one believed in grammar and the grammatical subject one said i is the condition think is the predicate and is conditioned to think is an activity for which one must suppose a subject as cause the attempt was then made with marvelous tenacity and subtlety to see if one could not get out of this net to see if the opposite was not perhaps true think the condition and i the conditioned i therefore only a synthesis which has been made by thinking itself kant really wished to prove that starting from the subject the subject could not be proved nor the object either the possibility of an apparent existence of the subject and therefore of the soul may not always have been strange to him the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the vedanta philosophy there is a great ladder of religious cruelty with many rounds but three of these are the most important once on a time men sacrificed human beings to their god and perhaps just those they loved the best to this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitive religions and also the sacrifice of the emperor tiberius in the mithra grotto on the island of capri that most terrible of all roman anachronisms then during the moral epoch of mankind they sacrificed to their god the strongest instincts they possessed their nature this festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and anti natural fanatics finally what still remained to be sacrificed was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything comforting holy healing all hope all faith in hidden harmonies in future blessedness and justice was it not necessary to sacrifice god himself and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone stupidity gravity fate nothingness to sacrifice god for nothingness this paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for the rising generation we all know something thereof already whoever like myself prompted by some enigmatical desire has long endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it from the half christian half german narrowness and stupidity in which it has finally presented itself to this century namely in the form of schopenhauer s philosophy whoever with an asiatic and super asiatic eye has actually looked inside and into the most world renouncing of all possible modes of thought beyond good and evil and no longer like buddha and schopenhauer under the dominion and delusion of morality whoever has done this has perhaps just thereby without really desiring it opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal the ideal of the most world approving exuberant and vivacious man who has not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and is but wishes to have it again as it was and is for all eternity insatiably calling out da capo not only to himself but to the whole piece and play and not only the play but actually to him who requires the play and makes it necessary because he always requires himself anew and makes himself necessary what and this would not be circulus vitiosus deus the distance and as it were the space around man grows with the strength of his intellectual vision and insight his world becomes profounder new stars new enigmas and notions are ever coming into view perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercised its acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercise something of a game something for children and childish minds perhaps the most solemn conceptions that have caused the most fighting and suffering the conceptions god and sin will one day seem to us of no more importance than a child s plaything or a child s pain seems to an old man and perhaps another plaything and another pain will then be necessary once more for the old man always childish enough an eternal child has it been observed to what extent outward idleness or semi idleness is necessary to a real religious life alike for its favourite microscopic labour of self examination and for its soft placidity called prayer the state of perpetual readiness for the coming of god i mean the idleness with a good conscience the idleness of olden times and of blood to which the aristocratic sentiment that work is dishonouring that it vulgarizes body and soul is not quite unfamiliar and that consequently the modern noisy time engrossing conceited foolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares for unbelief more than anything else among these for instance who are at present living apart from religion in germany i find free thinkers of diversified species and origin but above all a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation has dissolved the religious instincts so that they no longer know what purpose religions serve and only note their existence in the world with a kind of dull astonishment they feel themselves already fully occupied these good people be it by their business or by their pleasures not to mention the fatherland and the newspapers and their family duties it seems that they have no time whatever left for religion and above all it is not obvious to them whether it is a question of a new business or a new pleasure for it is impossible they say to themselves that people should go to church merely to spoil their tempers they are by no means enemies of religious customs should certain circumstances state affairs perhaps require their participation in such customs they do what is required as so many things are done with a patient and unassuming seriousness and without much curiosity or discomfort they live too much apart and outside to feel even the necessity for a for or against in such matters among those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of german protestants of the middle classes especially in the great laborious centres of trade and commerce also the majority of laborious scholars and the entire university personnel with the exception of the theologians whose existence and possibility there always gives psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve on the part of pious or merely church going people there is seldom any idea of how much good will one might say arbitrary will is now necessary for a german scholar to take the problem of religion seriously his whole profession and as i have said his whole workmanlike laboriousness to which he is compelled by his modern conscience inclines him to a lofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion with which is occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the uncleanliness of spirit which he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belong to the church it is only with the help of history not through his own personal experience therefore that the scholar succeeds in bringing himself to a respectful seriousness and to a certain timid deference in presence of religions but even when his sentiments have reached the stage of gratitude towards them he has not personally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself as church or as piety perhaps even the contrary the practical indifference to religious matters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up usually sublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness which shuns contact with religious men and things and it may be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it every age has its own divine type of naivete for the discovery of which other ages may envy it and how much naivete adorable childlike and boundlessly foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in his superiority in the good conscience of his tolerance in the unsuspecting simple certainty with which his instinct treats the religious man as a lower and less valuable type beyond before and above which he himself has developed he the little arrogant dwarf and mob man the sedulously alert head and hand drudge of ideas of modern ideas whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial it is their preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty lightsome and false here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adoration of pure forms in philosophers as well as in artists it is not to be doubted that whoever has need of the cult of the superficial to that extent has at one time or another made an unlucky dive beneath it perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt children the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying to falsify its image as if taking wearisome revenge on it one might guess to what degree life has disgusted them by the extent to which they wish to see its image falsified attenuated ultrified and deified one might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists as their highest rank it is the profound suspicious fear of an incurable pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a religious interpretation of existence the fear of the instinct which divines that truth might be attained too soon before man has become strong enough hard enough artist enough piety the life in god regarded in this light would appear as the most elaborate and ultimate product of the fear of truth as artist adoration and artist intoxication in presence of the most logical of all falsifications as the will to the inversion of truth to untruth at any price perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective means of beautifying man than piety by means of it man can become so artful so superficial so iridescent and so good that his appearance no longer offends to love mankind for god s sake this has so far been the noblest and remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained that love to mankind without any redeeming intention in the background is only an additional folly and brutishness that the inclination to this love has first to get its proportion its delicacy its gram of salt and sprinkling of ambergris from a higher inclination whoever first perceived and experienced this however his tongue may have stammered as it attempted to express such a delicate matter let him for all time be holy and respected as the man who has so far flown highest and gone astray in the finest fashion the philosopher as we free spirits understand him as the man of the greatest responsibility who has the conscience for the general development of mankind will use religion for his disciplining and educating work just as he will use the contemporary political and economic conditions the selecting and disciplining influence destructive as well as creative and fashioning which can be exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied according to the sort of people placed under its spell and protection for those who are strong and independent destined and trained to command in whom the judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated religion is an additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of authority as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter their inmost heart which would fain escape obedience and in the case of the unique natures of noble origin if by virtue of superior spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative life reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of government over chosen disciples or members of an order religion itself may be used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of managing grosser affairs and for securing immunity from the unavoidable filth of all political agitation the brahmins for instance understood this fact with the help of a religious organization they secured to themselves the power of nominating kings for the people while their sentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside as men with a higher and super regal mission at the same time religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for future ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes in which through fortunate marriage customs volitional power and delight in self control are on the increase to them religion offers sufficient incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality and to experience the sentiments of authoritative self control of silence and of solitude asceticism and puritanism are almost indispensable means of educating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy and finally to ordinary men to the majority of the people who exist for service and general utility and are only so far entitled to exist religion gives invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition peace of heart ennoblement of obedience additional social happiness and sympathy with something of transfiguration and embellishment something of justification of all the commonplaceness all the meanness all the semi animal poverty of their souls religion together with the religious significance of life sheds sunshine over such perpetually harassed men and makes even their own aspect endurable to them it operates upon them as the epicurean philosophy usually operates upon sufferers of a higher order in a refreshing and refining manner almost turning suffering to account and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it there is perhaps nothing so admirable in christianity and buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things and thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it difficult enough to live this very difficulty being necessary to be sure to make also the bad counter reckoning against such religions and to bring to light their secret dangers the cost is always excessive and terrible when religions do not operate as an educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher but rule voluntarily and paramountly when they wish to be the final end and not a means along with other means among men as among all other animals there is a surplus of defective diseased degenerating infirm and necessarily suffering individuals the successful cases among men also are always the exception and in view of the fact that man is the animal not yet properly adapted to his environment the rare exception but worse still the higher the type a man represents the greater is the improbability that he will succeed the accidental the law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind manifests itself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of men the conditions of whose lives are delicate diverse and difficult to determine what then is the attitude of the two greatest religions above mentioned to the surplus of failures in life they endeavour to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved in fact as the religions for sufferers they take the part of these upon principle they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a disease and they would fain treat every other experience of life as false and impossible however highly we may esteem this indulgent and preservative care inasmuch as in applying to others it has applied and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of man the hitherto paramount religions to give a general appreciation of them are among the principal causes which have kept the type of man upon a lower level they have preserved too much that which should have perished one has to thank them for invaluable services and who is sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation of all that the spiritual men of christianity have done for europe hitherto but when they had given comfort to the sufferers courage to the oppressed and despairing a staff and support to the helpless and when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual penitentiaries the broken hearted and distracted what else had they to do in order to work systematically in that fashion and with a good conscience for the preservation of all the sick and suffering which means in deed and in truth to work for the deterioration of the european race to reverse all estimates of value that is what they had to do and to shatter the strong to spoil great hopes to cast suspicion on the delight in beauty to break down everything autonomous manly conquering and imperious all instincts which are natural to the highest and most successful type of man into uncertainty distress of conscience and self destruction forsooth to invert all love of the earthly and of supremacy over the earth into hatred of the earth and earthly things that is the task the church imposed on itself and was obliged to impose until according to its standard of value unworldliness unsensuousness and higher man fused into one sentiment if one could observe the strangely painful equally coarse and refined comedy of european christianity with the derisive and impartial eye of an epicurean god i should think one would never cease marvelling and laughing does it not actually seem that some single will has ruled over europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a sublime abortion of man he however who with opposite requirements no longer epicurean and with some divine hammer in his hand could approach this almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind as exemplified in the european christian pascal for instance would he not have to cry aloud with rage pity and horror oh you bunglers presumptuous pitiful bunglers what have you done was that a work for your hands how you have hacked and botched my finest stone what have you presumed to do i should say that christianity has hitherto been the most portentous of presumptions men not great enough nor hard enough to be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning man men not sufficiently strong and far sighted to allow with sublime self constraint the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and perishings to prevail men not sufficiently noble to see the radically different grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from man such men with their equality before god have hitherto swayed the destiny of europe until at last a dwarfed almost ludicrous species has been

not have done that says my pride and remains inexorable eventually the memory yields one has regarded life carelessly if one has failed to see the hand that kills with leniency if a man has character he has also his typical experience which always recurs the sage as astronomer so long as thou feelest the stars as an above thee thou lackest the eye of the discerning one it is not the strength but the duration of great sentiments that makes great men he who attains his ideal precisely thereby surpasses it a many a peacock hides his tail from every eye and calls it his pride a man of genius is unbearable unless he possess at least two things besides gratitude and purity the degree and nature of a man s sensuality extends to the highest altitudes of his spirit under peaceful conditions the militant man attacks himself with his principles a man seeks either to dominate or justify or honour or reproach or conceal his habits two men with the same principles probably seek fundamentally different ends therewith he who despises himself nevertheless esteems himself thereby as a despiser a soul which knows that it is loved but does not itself love betrays its sediment its dregs come up

scientific man it is terrible to die of thirst at sea is it necessary that you should so salt your truth that it will no longer quench thirst sympathy for all would be harshness and tyranny for thee my good neighbour instinct when the house is on fire one forgets even the dinner yes but one recovers it from among the ashes woman learns how to hate in proportion as she forgets how to charm the same emotions are in man and woman but in different tempo on that account man and woman never cease to misunderstand each other in the background of all their personal vanity women themselves have still their impersonal scorn for woman fettered heart free spirit when one firmly fetters one s heart and keeps it prisoner one can allow one s spirit many liberties i said this once before but people do not believe it when i say so unless they know it already one begins to distrust very clever persons when they become embarrassed dreadful experiences raise the question whether he who experiences them is not something dreadful also heavy melancholy men turn lighter and come temporarily to their surface precisely by that which makes others heavy by hatred and love so cold so icy that one burns one s finger at the touch of him every hand that lays hold of him shrinks back and for that very reason many think him red hot who has not at one time or another sacrificed himself for the sake of his good name in affability there is no hatred of men but precisely on that account a great deal too much contempt of men the maturity of man that means to have reacquired the seriousness that one had as a child at play to be ashamed of one s immorality is a step on the ladder at the end of which one is ashamed also of one s morality one should part from life as ulysses parted from nausicaa blessing it rather than in love with it what a great man i always see merely the play actor of his own ideal when one trains one s conscience it kisses one while it bites the disappointed one speaks i listened for the echo and i heard only praise we all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are we thus relax ourselves away from our fellows a discerning one might easily regard himself at present as the animalization of god discovering reciprocal love should really disenchant the lover with regard to the beloved what she is modest enough to love even you or stupid enough or or the danger in happiness everything now turns out best for me i now love every fate who would like to be my fate not their love of humanity but the impotence of their love prevents the christians of today burning us the pia fraus is still more repugnant to the taste the piety of the free spirit the pious man of knowledge than the impia fraus hence the profound lack of judgment in comparison with the church characteristic of the type free spirit as its non freedom by means of music the very passions enjoy themselves a sign of strong character when once the resolution has been taken to shut the ear even to the best counter arguments occasionally therefore a will to stupidity there is no such thing as moral phenomena but only a moral interpretation of phenomena the criminal is often enough not equal to his deed he extenuates and maligns it the advocates of a criminal are seldom artists enough to turn the beautiful terribleness of the deed to the advantage of the doer our vanity is most difficult to wound just when our pride has been wounded to him who feels himself preordained to contemplation and not to belief all believers are too noisy and obtrusive he guards against them you want to prepossess him in your favour then you must be embarrassed before him the immense expectation with regard to sexual love and the coyness in this expectation spoils all the perspectives of women at the outset where there is neither love nor hatred in the game woman s play is mediocre the great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain courage to rebaptize our badness as the best in us the will to overcome an emotion is ultimately only the will of another or of several other emotions there is an innocence of admiration it is possessed by him to whom it has not yet occurred that he himself may be admired some day our loathing of dirt may be so great as to prevent our cleaning ourselves justifying ourselves sensuality often forces the growth of love too much so that its root remains weak and is easily torn up it is a curious thing that god learned greek when he wished to turn author and that he did not learn it better to rejoice on account of praise is in many cases merely politeness of heart and the very opposite of vanity of spirit even concubinage has been corrupted by marriage he who exults at the stake does not triumph over pain but because of the fact that he does not feel pain where he expected it a parable when we have to change an opinion about any one we charge heavily to his account the inconvenience he thereby causes us a nation is a detour of nature to arrive at six or seven great men yes and then to get round them in the eyes of all true women science is hostile to the sense of shame they feel as if one wished to peep under their skin with it or worse still under their dress and finery the more abstract the truth you wish to teach the more must you allure the senses to it the devil has the most extensive perspectives for god on that account he keeps so far away from him the devil in effect as the oldest friend of knowledge what a person is begins to betray itself when his talent decreases when he ceases to show what he can do talent is also an adornment an adornment is also a concealment the sexes deceive themselves about each other the reason is that in reality they honour and love only themselves or their own ideal to express it more agreeably thus man wishes woman to be peaceable but in fact woman is essentially unpeaceable like the cat however well she may have assumed the peaceable demeanour one is punished best

evidence of truth pharisaism is not a deterioration of the good man a considerable part of it is rather an essential condition of being good the one seeks an accoucheur for his thoughts the other seeks some one whom he can assist a good conversation thus originates in intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes of opposite kinds in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds a mediocre man and often even in a mediocre artist one finds a very remarkable man we do the same when awake as when dreaming we only invent and imagine him with whom we have intercourse and forget it immediately in revenge and in love woman is more barbarous than man advice as a riddle if the band is not to break bite it first secure to make the belly is the reason why man does not so readily take himself for a god the chastest utterance i ever heard dans le veritable amour c est l ame qui enveloppe le corps our vanity would like what we do best to pass precisely for what is most difficult to us concerning the origin of many systems of morals when a woman has scholarly inclinations there is generally something wrong with her sexual nature barrenness itself conduces to a certain virility of taste man indeed if i may say so is the barren animal comparing man and woman generally one may say that woman would not have the genius for adornment if she had not the instinct

than in blame pity has an almost ludicrous effect on a man of knowledge like tender hands on a cyclops one occasionally embraces some one or other out of love to mankind because one cannot embrace all but this is what one must never confess to the individual one does not hate as long as one disesteems but only when one esteems equal or superior ye utilitarians ye too love the utile only as a vehicle for your inclinations ye too really find the noise of its wheels insupportable one loves ultimately one s desires not the thing desired the vanity of others is only counter to our taste when it is counter to our vanity with regard to what truthfulness is perhaps nobody has ever been sufficiently truthful one does not believe in the follies of clever men what a forfeiture of the rights of

believe in you there is a haughtiness of kindness which has the appearance of wickedness i dislike him why i am not a match for him did any one ever answer so chapter v the natural history of morals the moral sentiment in europe at present is perhaps as subtle belated diverse sensitive and refined as the science of morals belonging thereto is recent initial awkward and coarse fingered an interesting contrast which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious in the very person of a moralist indeed the expression science of morals is in respect to what is designated thereby far too presumptuous and counter to good taste which is always a foretaste of more modest expressions one ought to avow with the utmost fairness what is still necessary here for a long time what is alone proper for the present namely the collection of material the comprehensive survey and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth and distinctions of worth which live grow propagate and perish and perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common forms of these living crystallizations as preparation for a theory of types of morality to be sure people have not hitherto been so modest all the philosophers with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness demanded of themselves something very much higher more pretentious and ceremonious when they concerned themselves with morality as a science they wanted to give a basic to morality and every philosopher hitherto has believed that he has given it a basis morality itself however has been regarded as something given how far from their awkward pride was the seemingly insignificant problem left in dust and decay of a description of forms of morality notwithstanding that the finest hands and senses could hardly be fine enough for it it was precisely owing to moral philosophers knowing the moral facts imperfectly in an arbitrary epitome or an accidental abridgement perhaps as the morality of their environment their position their church their zeitgeist their climate and zone it was precisely because they were badly instructed with regard to nations eras and past ages and were by no means eager to know about these matters that they did not even come in sight of the real problems of morals problems which only disclose themselves by a comparison of many kinds of morality in every science of morals hitherto strange as it may sound the problem of morality itself has been omitted there has been no suspicion that there was anything problematic there that which philosophers called giving a basis to morality and endeavoured to realize has when seen in a right light proved merely a learned form of good faith in prevailing morality a new means of its expression consequently just a matter of fact within the sphere of a definite morality yea in its ultimate motive a sort of denial that it is lawful for this morality to be called in question and in any case the reverse of the testing analyzing doubting and vivisecting of this very faith hear for instance with what innocence almost worthy of honour schopenhauer represents his own task and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a science whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and old wives the principle he says page of the grundprobleme der ethik footnote pages of schopenhauer s basis of morality translated by arthur b bullock m a the axiom about the purport of which all moralists are practically agreed neminem laede immo omnes quantum potes juva is really the proposition which all moral teachers strive to establish the real basis of ethics which has been sought like the philosopher s stone for centuries the difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be great it is well known that schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his efforts and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and sentimental this proposition is in a world whose essence is will to power may be reminded that schopenhauer although a pessimist actually played the flute daily after dinner one may read about the matter in his biography a question by the way a pessimist a repudiator of god and of the world who makes a halt at morality who assents to morality and plays the flute to laede neminem morals what is that really a pessimist apart from the value of such assertions as there is a categorical imperative in us one can always ask what does such an assertion indicate about him who makes it there are systems of morals which are meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people other systems of morals are meant to tranquilize him and make him self satisfied with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself with others he wishes to take revenge with others to conceal himself with others to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction this system of morals helps its author to forget that system makes him or something of him forgotten many a moralist would like to exercise power and creative arbitrariness over mankind many another perhaps kant especially gives us to understand by his morals that what is estimable in me is that i know how to obey and with you it shall not be otherwise than with me in short systems of morals are only a sign language of the emotions in contrast to laisser aller every system of morals is a sort of tyranny against nature and also against reason that is however no objection unless one should again decree by some system of morals that all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful what is essential and invaluable in every system of morals is that it is a long constraint in order to understand stoicism or port royal or puritanism one should remember the constraint under which every language has attained to strength and freedom the metrical constraint the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm how much trouble have the poets and orators of every nation given themselves not excepting some of the prose writers of today in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousness for the sake of a folly as utilitarian bunglers say and thereby deem themselves wise from submission to arbitrary laws as the anarchists say and thereby fancy themselves free even free spirited the singular fact remains however that everything of the nature of freedom elegance boldness dance and masterly certainty which exists or has existed whether it be in thought itself or in administration or in speaking and persuading in art just as in conduct has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary law and in all seriousness it is not at all improbable that precisely this is nature and natural and not laisser aller every artist knows how different from the state of letting himself go is his most natural condition the free arranging locating disposing and constructing in the moments of inspiration and how strictly and delicately he then obeys a thousand laws which by their very rigidness and precision defy all formulation by means of ideas even the most stable idea has in comparison therewith something floating manifold and ambiguous in it the essential thing in heaven and in earth is apparently to repeat it once more that there should be long obedience in the same direction there thereby results and has always resulted in the long run something which has made life worth living for instance virtue art music dancing reason spirituality anything whatever that is transfiguring refined foolish or divine the long bondage of the spirit the distrustful constraint in the communicability of ideas the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance with the rules of a church or a court or conformable to aristotelian premises the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything that happened according to a christian scheme and in every occurrence to rediscover and justify the christian god all this violence arbitrariness severity dreadfulness and unreasonableness has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the european spirit has attained its strength its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be stifled suffocated and spoilt in the process for here as everywhere nature shows herself as she is in all her extravagant and indifferent magnificence which is shocking but nevertheless noble that for centuries european thinkers only thought in order to prove something nowadays on the contrary we are suspicious of every thinker who wishes to prove something that it was always settled beforehand what was to be the result of their strictest thinking as it was perhaps in the asiatic astrology of former times or as it is still at the present day in the innocent christian moral explanation of immediate personal events for the glory of god or for the good of the soul this tyranny this arbitrariness this severe and magnificent stupidity has educated the spirit slavery both in the coarser and the finer sense is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual education and discipline one may look at every system of morals in this light it is nature therein which teaches to hate the laisser aller the too great freedom and implants the need for limited horizons for immediate duties it teaches the narrowing of perspectives and thus in a certain sense that stupidity is a condition of life and development thou must obey some one and for a long time otherwise thou wilt come to grief and lose all respect for thyself this seems to me to be the moral imperative of nature which is certainly neither categorical as old kant wished consequently the otherwise nor does it address itself to the individual what does nature care for the individual but to nations races ages and ranks above all however to the animal man generally to mankind industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle it was a master stroke of english instinct to hallow and begloom sunday to such an extent that the englishman unconsciously hankers for his week and work day again as a kind of cleverly devised cleverly intercalated fast such as is also frequently found in the ancient world although as is appropriate in southern nations not precisely with respect to work many kinds of fasts are necessary and wherever powerful influences and habits prevail legislators have to see that intercalary days are appointed on which such impulses are fettered and learn to hunger anew viewed from a higher standpoint whole generations and epochs when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting during which an impulse learns to humble and submit itself at the same time also to purify and sharpen itself certain philosophical sects likewise admit of a similar interpretation for instance the stoa in the midst of hellenic culture with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with aphrodisiacal odours here also is a hint for the explanation of the paradox why it was precisely in the most christian period of european history and in general only under the pressure of christian sentiments that the sexual impulse sublimated into love amour passion there is something in the morality of plato which does not really belong to plato but which only appears in his philosophy one might say in spite of him namely socratism for which he himself was too noble no one desires to injure himself hence all evil is done unwittingly the evil man inflicts injury on himself he would not do so however if he knew that evil is evil the evil man therefore is only evil through error if one free him from error one will necessarily make him good this mode of reasoning savours of the populace who perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil doing and practically judge that it is stupid to do wrong while they accept good as identical with useful and pleasant without further thought as regards every system of utilitarianism one may at once assume that it has the same origin and follow the scent one will seldom err plato did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the tenets of his teacher and above all to interpret himself into them he the most daring of all interpreters who lifted the entire socrates out of the street as a popular theme and song to exhibit him in endless and impossible modifications namely in all his own disguises and multiplicities in jest and in homeric language as well what is the platonic socrates if not greek words inserted here the old theological problem of faith and knowledge or more plainly of instinct and reason the question whether in respect to the valuation of things instinct deserves more authority than rationality which wants to appreciate and act according to motives according to a why that is to say in conformity to purpose and utility it is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of socrates and had divided men s minds long before christianity socrates himself following of course the taste of his talent that of a surpassing dialectician took first the side of reason and in fact what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the noble athenians who were men of instinct like all noble men and could never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions in the end however though silently and secretly he laughed also at himself with his finer conscience and introspection he found in himself the same difficulty and incapacity but why he said to himself should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts one must set them right and the reason also one must follow the instincts but at the same time persuade the reason to support them with good arguments this was the real falseness of that great and mysterious ironist he brought his conscience up to the point that he was satisfied with a kind of self outwitting in fact he perceived the irrationality in the moral judgment plato more innocent in such matters and without the craftiness of the plebeian wished to prove to himself at the expenditure of all his strength the greatest strength a philosopher had ever expended that reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one goal to the good to god and since plato all theologians and philosophers have followed the same path which means that in matters of morality instinct or as christians call it faith or as i call it the herd has hitherto triumphed unless one should make an exception in the case of descartes the father of rationalism and consequently the grandfather of the revolution who recognized only the authority of reason but reason is only a tool and descartes was superficial whoever has followed the history of a single science finds in its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest processes of all knowledge and cognizance there as here the premature hypotheses the fictions the good stupid will to belief and the lack of distrust and patience are first developed our senses learn late and never learn completely to be subtle reliable and cautious organs of knowledge our eyes find it easier on a given occasion to produce a picture already often produced than to seize upon the divergence and novelty of an impression the latter requires more force more morality it is difficult and painful for the ear to listen to anything new we hear strange music badly when we hear another language spoken we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds into words with which we are more familiar and conversant it was thus for example that the germans modified the spoken word arcubalista into armbrust cross bow our senses are also hostile and averse to the new and generally even in the simplest processes of sensation the emotions dominate such as fear love hatred and the passive emotion of indolence as little as a reader nowadays reads all the single words not to speak of syllables of a page he rather takes about five out of every twenty words at random and guesses the probably appropriate sense to them just as little do we see a tree correctly and completely in respect to its leaves branches colour and shape we find it so much easier to fancy the chance of a tree even in the midst of the most remarkable experiences we still do just the same we fabricate the greater part of the experience and can hardly be made to contemplate any event except as inventors thereof all this goes to prove that from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we have been accustomed to lying or to express it more politely and hypocritically in short more pleasantly one is much more of an artist than one is aware of in an animated conversation i often see the face of the person with whom i am speaking so clearly and sharply defined before me according to the thought he expresses or which i believe to be evoked in his mind that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the strength of my visual faculty the delicacy of the play of the muscles and of the expression of the eyes must therefore be imagined by me probably the person put on quite a different expression or none at all quidquid luce fuit tenebris agit but also contrariwise what we experience in dreams provided we experience it often pertains at last just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything actually experienced by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer we have a requirement more or less and finally in broad daylight and even in the brightest moments of our waking life we are ruled to some extent by the nature of our dreams supposing that someone has often flown in his dreams and that at last as soon as he dreams he is conscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and his peculiarly enviable happiness such a person who believes that on the slightest impulse he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles who knows the sensation of a certain divine levity an upwards without effort or constraint a downwards without descending or lowering without trouble how could the man with such dream experiences and dream habits fail to find happiness differently coloured and defined even in his waking hours how could he fail to long differently for happiness flight such as is described by poets must when compared with his own flying be far too earthly muscular violent far too troublesome for him the difference among men does not manifest itself only in the difference of their lists of desirable things in their regarding different good things as worth striving for and being disagreed as to the greater or less value the order of rank of the commonly recognized desirable things it manifests itself much more in what they regard as actually having and possessing a desirable thing as regards a woman for instance the control over her body and her sexual gratification serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more modest man another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for possession sees the questionableness the mere apparentness of such ownership and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially whether the woman not only gives herself to him but also gives up for his sake what she has or would like to have only then does he look upon her as possessed a third however has not even here got to the limit of his distrust and his desire for possession he asks himself whether the woman when she gives up everything for him does not perhaps do so for a phantom of him he wishes first to be thoroughly indeed profoundly well known in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be found out only then does he feel the beloved one fully in his possession when she no longer deceives herself about him when she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed insatiability as for his goodness patience and spirituality one man would like to possess a nation and he finds all the higher arts of cagliostro and catalina suitable for his purpose another with a more refined thirst for possession says to himself one may not deceive where one desires to possess he is irritated and impatient at the idea that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people i must therefore make myself known and first of all learn to know myself among helpful and charitable people one almost always finds the awkward craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped as though for instance he should merit help seek just their help and would show himself deeply grateful attached and subservient to them for all help with these conceits they take control of the needy as a property just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a desire for property one finds them jealous when they are crossed or forestalled in their charity parents involuntarily make something like themselves out of their children they call that education no mother doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is thereby her property no father hesitates about his right to his own ideas and notions of worth indeed in former times fathers deemed it right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly born as among the ancient germans and like the father so also do the teacher the class the priest and the prince still see in every new individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession the consequence is the jews a people born for slavery as tacitus and the whole ancient world say of them the chosen people among the nations as they themselves say and believe the jews performed the miracle of the inversion of valuations by means of which life on earth obtained a new and dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums their prophets fused into one the expressions rich godless wicked violent sensual and for the first time coined the word world as a term of reproach in this inversion of valuations in which is also included the use of the word poor as synonymous with saint and friend the significance of the jewish people is to be found it is with them that the slave insurrection in morals commences it is to be inferred that there are countless dark bodies near the sun such as we shall never see among ourselves this is an allegory and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star writing merely as an allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed the beast of prey and the man of prey for instance caesar borgia are fundamentally misunderstood nature is misunderstood so long as one seeks a morbidness in the constitution of these healthiest of all tropical monsters and growths or even an innate hell in them as almost all moralists have done hitherto does it not seem that there is a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists and that the tropical man must be discredited at all costs whether as disease and deterioration of mankind or as his own hell and self torture and why in favour of the temperate zones in favour of the temperate men the moral the mediocre this for the chapter morals as timidity all the systems of morals which address themselves with a view to their happiness as it is called what else are they but suggestions for behaviour adapted to the degree of danger from themselves in which the individuals live recipes for their passions their good and bad propensities insofar as such have the will to power and would like to play the master small and great expediencies and elaborations permeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old wife wisdom all of them grotesque and absurd in their form because they address themselves to all because they generalize where generalization is not authorized all of them speaking unconditionally and taking themselves unconditionally all of them flavoured not merely with one grain of salt but rather endurable only and sometimes even seductive when they are over spiced and begin to smell dangerously especially of the other world that is all of little value when estimated intellectually and is far from being science much less wisdom but repeated once more and three times repeated it is expediency expediency expediency mixed with stupidity stupidity stupidity whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness towards the heated folly of the emotions which the stoics advised and fostered or the no more laughing and no more weeping of spinoza the destruction of the emotions by their analysis and vivisection which he recommended so naively or the lowering of the emotions to an innocent mean at which they may be satisfied the aristotelianism of morals or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntary attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art perhaps as music or as love of god and of mankind for god s sake for in religion the passions are once more enfranchised provided that or finally even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions as has been taught by hafis and goethe the bold letting go of the reins the spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of wise old codgers and drunkards with whom it no longer has much danger this also for the chapter morals as timidity inasmuch as in all ages as long as mankind has existed there have also been human herds family alliances communities tribes peoples states churches and always a great number who obey in proportion to the small number who command in view therefore of the fact that obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto one may reasonably suppose that generally speaking the need thereof is now innate in every one as a kind of formal conscience which gives the command thou shalt unconditionally do something unconditionally refrain from something in short thou shalt this need tries to satisfy itself and to fill its form with a content according to its strength impatience and eagerness it at once seizes as an omnivorous appetite with little selection and accepts whatever is shouted into its ear by all sorts of commanders parents teachers laws class prejudices or public opinion the extraordinary limitation of human development the hesitation protractedness frequent retrogression and turning thereof is attributable to the fact that the herd instinct of obedience is transmitted best and at the cost of the art of command if one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent commanders and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether or they will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience and will have to impose a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to command just as if they also were only obeying this condition of things actually exists in europe at present i call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding class they know no other way of protecting themselves from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and higher orders of predecessors of the constitution of justice of the law or of god himself or they even justify themselves by maxims from the current opinions of the herd as first servants of their people or instruments of the public weal on the other hand the gregarious european man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only kind of man that is allowable he glorifies his qualities such as public spirit kindness deference industry temperance modesty indulgence sympathy by virtue of which he is gentle endurable and useful to the herd as the peculiarly human virtues in cases however where it is believed that the leader and bell wether cannot be dispensed with attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative constitutions for example are of this origin in spite of all what a blessing what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable is the appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious europeans of this fact the effect of the appearance of napoleon was the last great proof the history of the influence of napoleon is almost the history of the higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in its worthiest individuals and periods the man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with one another who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his body that is to say contrary and often not only contrary instincts and standards of value which struggle with one another and are seldom at peace such a man of late culture and broken lights will on an average be a weak man his fundamental desire is that the war which is in him should come to an end happiness appears to him in the character of a soothing medicine and mode of thought for instance epicurean or christian it is above all things the happiness of repose of undisturbedness of repletion of final unity it is the sabbath of sabbaths to use the expression of the holy rhetorician st augustine who was himself such a man should however the contrariety and conflict in such natures operate as an additional incentive and stimulus to life and if on the other hand in addition to their powerful and irreconcilable instincts they have also inherited and indoctrinated into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict with themselves that is to say the faculty of self control and self deception there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and inexplicable beings those enigmatical men predestined for conquering and circumventing others the finest examples of which are alcibiades and caesar with whom i should like to associate the first of europeans according to my taste the hohenstaufen frederick the second and among artists perhaps leonardo da vinci they appear precisely in the same periods when that weaker type with its longing for repose comes to the front the two types are complementary to each other and spring from the same causes as long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only gregarious utility as long as the preservation of the community is only kept in view and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community there can be no morality of love to one s neighbour granted even that there is already a little constant exercise of consideration sympathy fairness gentleness and mutual assistance granted that even in this condition of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly distinguished by honourable names as virtues and eventually almost coincide with the conception morality in that period they do not as yet belong to the domain of moral valuations they are still ultra moral a sympathetic action for instance is neither called good nor bad moral nor immoral in the best period of the romans and should it be praised a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this praise even at the best directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole to the res publica after all love to our neighbour is always a secondary matter partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our fear of our neighbour after the fabric of society seems on the whole established and secured against external dangers it is this fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral valuation certain strong and dangerous instincts such as the love of enterprise foolhardiness revengefulness astuteness rapacity and love of power which up till then had not only to be honoured from the point of view of general utility under other names of course than those here given but had to be fostered and cultivated because they were perpetually required in the common danger against the common enemies are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong when the outlets for them are lacking and are gradually branded as immoral and given over to calumny the contrary instincts and inclinations now attain to moral honour the gregarious instinct gradually draws its conclusions how much or how little dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion a condition an emotion a disposition or an endowment that is now the moral perspective here again fear is the mother of morals it is by the loftiest and strongest instincts when they break out passionately and carry the individual far above and beyond the average and the low level of the gregarious conscience that the self reliance of the community is destroyed its belief in itself its backbone as it were breaks consequently these very instincts will be most branded and defamed the lofty independent spirituality the will to stand alone and even the cogent reason are felt to be dangers everything that elevates the individual above the herd and is a source of fear to the neighbour is henceforth called evil the tolerant unassuming self adapting self equalizing disposition the mediocrity of desires attains to moral distinction and honour finally under very peaceful circumstances there is always less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity and rigour and now every form of severity even in justice begins to disturb the conscience a lofty and rigorous nobleness and self responsibility almost offends and awakens distrust the lamb and still more the sheep wins respect there is a point of diseased mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society at which society itself takes the part of him who injures it the part of the criminal and does so in fact seriously and honestly to punish appears to it to be somehow unfair it is certain that the idea of punishment and the obligation to punish are then painful and alarming to people is it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered harmless why should we still punish punishment itself is terrible with these questions gregarious morality the morality of fear draws its ultimate conclusion if one could at all do away with danger the cause of fear one would have done away with this morality at the same time it would no longer be necessary it would not consider itself any longer necessary whoever examines the conscience of the present day european will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds and hidden recesses the imperative of the timidity of the herd we wish that some time or other there may be nothing more to fear some time or other the will and the way thereto is nowadays called progress all over europe let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred times for people s ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths our truths we know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one plainly and without metaphor counts man among the animals but it will be accounted to us almost a crime that it is precisely in respect to men of modern ideas that we have constantly applied the terms herd herd instincts and such like expressions what avail is it we cannot do otherwise for it is precisely here that our new insight is we have found that in all the principal moral judgments europe has become unanimous including likewise the countries where european influence prevails in europe people evidently know what socrates thought he did not know and what the famous serpent of old once promised to teach they know today what is good and evil it must then sound hard and be distasteful to the ear when we always insist that that which here thinks it knows that which here glorifies itself with praise and blame and calls itself good is the instinct of the herding human animal the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more to the front to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of which it is the symptom morality in europe at present is herding animal morality and therefore as we understand the matter only one kind of human morality beside which before which and after which many other moralities and above all higher moralities are or should be possible against such a possibility against such a should be however this morality defends itself with all its strength it says obstinately and inexorably i am morality itself and nothing else is morality indeed with the help of a religion which has humoured and flattered the sublimest desires of the herding animal things have reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of this morality even in political and social arrangements the democratic movement is the inheritance of the christian movement that its tempo however is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones for those who are sick and distracted by the herding instinct is indicated by the increasingly furious howling and always less disguised teeth gnashing of the anarchist dogs who are now roving through the highways of european culture apparently in opposition to the peacefully industrious democrats and revolution ideologues and still more so to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity visionaries who call themselves socialists and want a free society those are really at one with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form of society other than that of the autonomous herd to the extent even of repudiating the notions master and servant ni dieu ni maitre says a socialist formula at one in their tenacious opposition to every special claim every special right and privilege this means ultimately opposition to every right for when all are equal no one needs rights any longer at one in their distrust of punitive justice as though it were a violation of the weak unfair to the necessary consequences of all former society but equally at one in their religion of sympathy in their compassion for all that feels lives and suffers down to the very animals up even to god the extravagance of sympathy for god belongs to a democratic age altogether at one in the cry and impatience of their sympathy in their deadly hatred of suffering generally in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or allowing it at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart softening under the spell of which europe seems to be threatened with a new buddhism at one in their belief in the morality of mutual sympathy as though it were morality in itself the climax the attained climax of mankind the sole hope of the future the consolation of the present the great discharge from all the obligations of the past altogether at one in their belief in the community as the deliverer in the herd and therefore in themselves we who hold a different belief we who regard the democratic movement not only as a degenerating form of political organization but as equivalent to a degenerating a waning type of man as involving his mediocrising and depreciation where have we to fix our hopes in new philosophers there is no other alternative in minds strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value to transvalue and invert eternal valuations in forerunners in men of the future who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which will compel millenniums to take new paths to teach man the future of humanity as his will as depending on human will and to make preparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in rearing and educating in order thereby to put an end to the frightful rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name of history the folly of the greatest number is only its last form for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will some time or other be needed at the very idea of which everything that has existed in the way of occult terrible and benevolent beings might look pale and dwarfed the image of such leaders hovers before our eyes is it lawful for me to say it aloud ye free spirits the conditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for their genesis the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a constraint to these tasks a transvaluation of values under the new pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart transformed into brass so as to bear the weight of such responsibility and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders the dreadful danger that they might be lacking or miscarry and degenerate these are our real anxieties and glooms ye know it well ye free spirits these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the heaven of our life there are few pains so grievous as to have seen divined or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and deteriorated but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger of man himself deteriorating he who like us has recognized the extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in respect to the future of mankind a game in which neither the hand nor even a finger of god has participated he who divines the fate that is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of modern ideas and still more under the whole of christo european morality suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared he sees at a glance all that could still be made out of man through a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and arrangements he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction how unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities and how often in the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisions and new paths he knows still better from his painfulest recollections on what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank have hitherto usually gone to pieces broken down sunk and become contemptible the universal degeneracy of mankind to the level of the man of the future as idealized by the socialistic fools and shallow pates this degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely gregarious animal or as they call it to a man of free society this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims is undoubtedly possible he who has thought out this possibility to its ultimate conclusion knows another loathing unknown to the rest of mankind and perhaps also a new mission chapter vi we scholars at the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that which it has always been namely resolutely montrer ses plaies according to balzac i would venture to protest against an improper and injurious alteration of rank which quite unnoticed and as if with the best conscience threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations of science and philosophy i mean to say that one must have the right out of one s own experience experience as it seems to me always implies unfortunate experience to treat of such an important question of rank so as not to speak of colour like the blind or against science like women and artists ah this dreadful science sigh their instinct and their shame it always finds things out the declaration of independence of the scientific man his emancipation from philosophy is one of the subtler after effects of democratic organization and disorganization the self glorification and self conceitedness of the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom and in its best springtime which does not mean to imply that in this case self praise smells sweet here also the instinct of the populace cries freedom from all masters and after science has with the happiest results resisted theology whose hand maid it had been too long it now proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for philosophy and in its turn to play the master what am i saying to play the philosopher on its own account my memory the memory of a scientific man if you please teems with the naivetes of insolence which i have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young naturalists and old physicians not to mention the most cultured and most conceited of all learned men the philologists and schoolmasters who are both the one and the other by profession on one occasion it was the specialist and the jack horner who instinctively stood on the defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities at another time it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of otium and refined luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher and felt himself aggrieved and belittled thereby on another occasion it was the colour blindness of the utilitarian who sees nothing in philosophy but a series of refuted systems and an extravagant expenditure which does nobody any good at another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of the boundary adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous at another time the disregard of individual philosophers which had involuntarily extended to disregard of philosophy generally in fine i found most frequently behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars the evil after effect of some particular philosopher to whom on the whole obedience had been foresworn without however the spell of his scornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of the result being a general ill will to all philosophy such seems to me for instance the after effect of schopenhauer on the most modern germany by his unintelligent rage against hegel he has succeeded in severing the whole of the last generation of germans from its connection with german culture which culture all things considered has been an elevation and a divining refinement of the historical sense but precisely at this point schopenhauer himself was poor irreceptive and un german to the extent of ingeniousness on the whole speaking generally it may just have been the humanness all too humanness of the modern philosophers themselves in short their contemptibleness which has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the doors to the instinct of the populace let it but be acknowledged to what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the world of heraclitus plato empedocles and whatever else all the royal and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called and with what justice an honest man of science may feel himself of a better family and origin in view of such representatives of philosophy who owing to the fashion of the present day are just as much aloft as they are down below in germany for instance the two lions of berlin the anarchist eugen duhring and the amalgamist eduard von hartmann it is especially the sight of those hotch potch philosophers who call themselves realists or positivists which is calculated to implant a dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those philosophers at the best are themselves but scholars and specialists that is very evident all of them are persons who have been vanquished and brought back again under the dominion of science who at one time or another claimed more from themselves without having a right to the more and its responsibility and who now creditably rancorously and vindictively represent in word and deed disbelief in the master task and supremacy of philosophy after all how could it be otherwise science flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible on its countenance while that to which the entire modern philosophy has gradually sunk the remnant of philosophy of the present day excites distrust and displeasure if not scorn and pity philosophy reduced to a theory of knowledge no more in fact than a diffident science of epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even gets beyond the threshold and rigorously denies itself the right to enter that is philosophy in its last throes an end an agony something that awakens pity how could such a philosophy rule the dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are in fact so manifold nowadays that one might doubt whether this fruit could still come to maturity the extent and towering structure of the sciences have increased enormously and therewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner or will attach himself somewhere and specialize so that he will no longer attain to his elevation that is to say to his superspection his circumspection and his despection or he gets aloft too late when the best of his maturity and strength is past or when he is impaired coarsened and deteriorated so that his view his general estimate of things is no longer of much importance it is perhaps just the refinement of his intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the way he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante a millepede a milleantenna he knows too well that as a discerner one who has lost his self respect no longer commands no longer leads unless he should aspire to become a great play actor a philosophical cagliostro and spiritual rat catcher in short a misleader this is in the last instance a question of taste if it has not really been a question of conscience to double once more the philosopher s difficulties there is also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict a yea or nay not concerning science but concerning life and the worth of life he learns unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain this verdict and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief only through the most extensive perhaps disturbing and destroying experiences often hesitating doubting and dumbfounded in fact the philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude either with the scientific man and ideal scholar or with the religiously elevated desensualized desecularized visionary and god intoxicated man and even yet when one hears anybody praised because he lives wisely or as a philosopher it hardly means anything more than prudently and apart wisdom that seems to the populace to be a kind of flight a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a bad game but the genuine philosopher does it not seem so to us my friends lives unphilosophically and unwisely above all imprudently and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts and temptations of life he risks himself constantly he plays this bad game in relation to the genius that is to say a being who either engenders or produces both words understood in their fullest sense the man of learning the scientific average man has always something of the old maid about him for like her he is not conversant with the two principal functions of man to both of course to the scholar and to the old maid one concedes respectability as if by way of indemnification in these cases one emphasizes the respectability and yet in the compulsion of this concession one has the same admixture of vexation let us examine more closely what is the scientific man firstly a commonplace type of man with commonplace virtues that is to say a non ruling non authoritative and non self sufficient type of man he possesses industry patient adaptableness to rank and file equability and moderation in capacity and requirement he has the instinct for people like himself and for that which they require for instance the portion of independence and green meadow without which there is no rest from labour the claim to honour and consideration which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability the sunshine of a good name the perpetual ratification of his value and usefulness with which the inward distrust which lies at the bottom of the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals has again and again to be overcome the learned man as is appropriate has also maladies and faults of an ignoble kind he is full of petty envy and has a lynx eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations he cannot attain he is confiding yet only as one who lets himself go but does not flow and precisely before the man of the great current he stands all the colder and more reserved his eye is then like a smooth and irresponsive lake which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy the worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results from the instinct of mediocrity of his type from the jesuitism of mediocrity which labours instinctively for the destruction of the exceptional man and endeavours to break or still better to relax every bent bow to relax of course with consideration and naturally with an indulgent hand to relax with confiding sympathy that is the real art of jesuitism which has always understood how to introduce itself as the religion of sympathy however gratefully one may welcome the objective spirit and who has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded ipsisimosity in the end however one must learn caution even with regard to one s gratitude and put a stop to the exaggeration with which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been celebrated as if it were the goal in itself as if it were salvation and glorification as is especially accustomed to happen in the pessimist school which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the highest honours to disinterested knowledge the objective man who no longer curses and scolds like the pessimist the ideal man of learning in whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand complete and partial failures is assuredly one of the most costly instruments that exist but his place is in the hand of one who is more powerful he is only an instrument we may say he is a mirror he is no purpose in himself the objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed to prostration before everything that wants to be known with such desires only as knowing or reflecting implies he waits until something comes and then expands himself sensitively so that even the light footsteps and gliding past of spiritual beings may not be lost on his surface and film whatever personality he still possesses seems to him accidental arbitrary or still oftener disturbing so much has he come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms and events he calls up the recollection of himself with an effort and not infrequently wrongly he readily confounds himself with other persons he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs and here only is he unrefined and negligent perhaps he is troubled about the health or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend or the lack of companions and society indeed he sets himself to reflect on his suffering but in vain his thoughts already rove away to the more general case and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how to help himself he does not now take himself seriously and devote time to himself he is serene not from lack of trouble but from lack of capacity for grasping and dealing with his trouble the habitual complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences the radiant and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that comes his way his habit of inconsiderate good nature of dangerous indifference as to yea and nay alas there are enough of cases in which he has to atone for these virtues of his and as man generally he becomes far too easily the caput mortuum of such virtues should one wish love or hatred from him i mean love and hatred as god woman and animal understand them he will do what he can and furnish what he can but one must not be surprised if it should not be much if he should show himself just at this point to be false fragile questionable and deteriorated his love is constrained his hatred is artificial and rather un tour de force a slight ostentation and exaggeration he is only genuine so far as he can be objective only in his serene totality is he still nature and natural his mirroring and eternally self polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm no longer how to deny he does not command neither does he destroy je ne meprise presque rien he says with leibniz let us not overlook nor undervalue the presque neither is he a model man he does not go in advance of any one nor after either he places himself generally too far off to have any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil if he has been so long confounded with the philosopher with the caesarian trainer and dictator of civilization he has had far too much honour and what is more essential in him has been overlooked he is an instrument something of a slave though certainly the sublimest sort of slave but nothing in himself presque rien the objective man is an instrument a costly easily injured easily tarnished measuring instrument and mirroring apparatus which is to be taken care of and respected but he is no goal not outgoing nor upgoing no complementary man in whom the rest of existence justifies itself no termination and still less a commencement an engendering or primary cause nothing hardy powerful self centred that wants to be master but rather only a soft inflated delicate movable potter s form that must wait for some kind of content and frame to shape itself thereto for the most part a man without frame and content a selfless man consequently also nothing for women in parenthesi when a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic i hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the objective spirit people all hear it impatiently they regard him on that account with some apprehension they would like to ask so many many questions indeed among timid hearers of whom there are now so many he is henceforth said to be dangerous with his repudiation of skepticism it seems to them as if they heard some evil threatening sound in the distance as if a new kind of explosive were being tried somewhere a dynamite of the spirit perhaps a newly discovered russian nihiline a pessimism bonae voluntatis that not only denies means denial but dreadful thought practises denial against this kind of good will a will to the veritable actual negation of life there is as is generally acknowledged nowadays no better soporific and sedative than skepticism the mild pleasing lulling poppy of skepticism and hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an antidote to the spirit and its underground noises are not our ears already full of bad sounds say the skeptics as lovers of repose and almost as a kind of safety police this subterranean nay is terrible be still ye pessimistic moles the skeptic in effect that delicate creature is far too easily frightened his conscience is schooled so as to start at every nay and even at that sharp decided yea and feels something like a bite thereby yea and nay they seem to him opposed to morality he loves on the contrary to make a festival to his virtue by a noble aloofness while perhaps he says with montaigne what do i know or with socrates i know that i know nothing or here i do not trust myself no door is open to me or even if the door were open why should i enter immediately or what is the use of any hasty hypotheses it might quite well be in good taste to make no hypotheses at all are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is crooked to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum is there not time enough for that has not the time leisure oh ye demons can ye not at all wait the uncertain also has its charms the sphinx too is a circe and circe too was a philosopher thus does a skeptic console himself and in truth he needs some consolation for skepticism is the most spiritual expression of a certain many sided physiological temperament which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and sickliness it arises whenever races or classes which have been long separated decisively and suddenly blend with one another in the new generation which has inherited as it were different standards and valuations in its blood everything is disquiet derangement doubt and tentativeness the best powers operate restrictively the very virtues prevent each other growing and becoming strong equilibrium ballast and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul that however which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the will they are no longer familiar with independence of decision or the courageous feeling of pleasure in willing they are doubtful of the freedom of the will even in their dreams our present day europe the scene of a senseless precipitate attempt at a radical blending of classes and consequently of races is therefore skeptical in all its heights and depths sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch sometimes with gloomy aspect like a cloud over charged with interrogative signs and often sick unto death of its will paralysis of will where do we not find this cripple sitting nowadays and yet how bedecked oftentimes how seductively ornamented there are the finest gala dresses and disguises for this disease and that for instance most of what places itself nowadays in the show cases as objectiveness the scientific spirit l art pour l art and pure voluntary knowledge is only decked out skepticism and paralysis of will i am ready to answer for this diagnosis of the european disease the disease of the will is diffused unequally over europe it is worst and most varied where civilization has longest prevailed it decreases according as the barbarian still or again asserts his claims under the loose drapery of western culture it is therefore in the france of today as can be readily disclosed and comprehended that the will is most infirm and france which has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the portentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over europe by being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism the power to will and to persist moreover in a resolution is already somewhat stronger in germany and again in the north of germany it is stronger than in central germany it is considerably stronger in england spain and corsica associated with phlegm in the former and with hard skulls in the latter not to mention italy which is too young yet to know what it wants and must first show whether it can exercise will but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense middle empire where europe as it were flows back to asia namely in russia there the power to will has been long stored up and accumulated there the will uncertain whether to be negative or affirmative waits threateningly to be discharged to borrow their pet phrase from our physicists perhaps not only indian wars and complications in asia would be necessary to free europe from its greatest danger but also internal subversion the shattering of the empire into small states and above all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility together with the obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast i do not say this as one who desires it in my heart i should rather prefer the contrary i mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of russia that europe would have to make up its mind to become equally threatening namely to acquire one will by means of a new caste to rule over the continent a persistent dreadful will of its own that can set its aims thousands of years ahead so that the long spun out comedy of its petty statism and its dynastic as well as its democratic many willed ness might finally be brought to a close the time for petty politics is past the next century will bring the struggle for the dominion of the world the compulsion to great politics as to how far the new warlike age on which we europeans have evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger kind of skepticism i should like to express myself preliminarily merely by a parable which the lovers of german history will already understand that unscrupulous enthusiast for big handsome grenadiers who as king of prussia brought into being a military and skeptical genius and therewith in reality the new and now triumphantly emerged type of german the problematic crazy father of frederick the great had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius he knew what was then lacking in germany the want of which was a hundred times more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social form his ill will to the young frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound instinct men were lacking and he suspected to his bitterest regret that his own son was not man enough there however he deceived himself but who would not have deceived himself in his place he saw his son lapsed to atheism to the esprit to the pleasant frivolity of clever frenchmen he saw in the background the great bloodsucker the spider skepticism he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no longer hard enough either for evil or good and of a broken will that no longer commands is no longer able to command meanwhile however there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous skepticism who knows to what extent it was encouraged just by his father s hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to solitude the skepticism of daring manliness which is closely related to the genius for war and conquest and made its first entrance into germany in the person of the great frederick this skepticism despises and nevertheless grasps it undermines and takes possession it does not believe but it does not thereby lose itself it gives the spirit a dangerous liberty but it keeps strict guard over the heart it is the german form of skepticism which as a continued fredericianism risen to the highest spirituality has kept europe for a considerable time under the dominion of the german spirit and its critical and historical distrust owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character of the great german philologists and historical critics who rightly estimated were also all of them artists of destruction and dissolution a new conception of the german spirit gradually established itself in spite of all romanticism in music and philosophy in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was decidedly prominent whether for instance as fearlessness of gaze as courage and sternness of the dissecting hand or as resolute will to dangerous voyages of discovery to spiritualized north pole expeditions under barren and dangerous skies there may be good grounds for it when warm blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this spirit cet esprit fataliste ironique mephistophelique as michelet calls it not without a shudder but if one would realize how characteristic is this fear of the man in the german spirit which awakened europe out of its dogmatic slumber let us call to mind the former conception which had to be overcome by this new one and that it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare with unbridled presumption to recommend the germans to the interest of europe as gentle good hearted weak willed and poetical fools finally let us only understand profoundly enough napoleon s astonishment when he saw goethe it reveals what had been regarded for centuries as the german spirit voila un homme that was as much as to say but this is a man and i only expected to see a german supposing then that in the picture of the philosophers of the future some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps be skeptics in the last mentioned sense something in them would only be designated thereby and not they themselves with equal right they might call themselves critics and assuredly they will be men of experiments by the name with which i ventured to baptize them i have already expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is this because as critics in body and soul they will love to make use of experiments in a new and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense in their passion for knowledge will they have to go further in daring and painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic century can approve of there is no doubt these coming ones will be least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities which distinguish the critic from the skeptic i mean the certainty as to standards of worth the conscious employment of a unity of method the wary courage the standing alone and the capacity for self responsibility indeed they will avow among themselves a delight in denial and dissection and a certain considerate cruelty which knows how to handle the knife surely and deftly even when the heart bleeds they will be sterner and perhaps not always towards themselves only than humane people may desire they will not deal with the truth in order that it may please them or elevate and inspire them they will rather have little faith in truth bringing with it such revels for the feelings they will smile those rigorous spirits when any one says in their presence that thought elevates me why should it not be true or that work enchants me why should it not be beautiful or that artist enlarges me why should he not be great perhaps they will not only have a smile but a genuine disgust for all that is thus rapturous idealistic feminine and hermaphroditic and if any one could look into their inmost hearts he would not easily find therein the intention to reconcile christian sentiments with antique taste or even with modern parliamentarism the kind of reconciliation necessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory century critical discipline and every habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of the future they may even make a display thereof as their special adornment nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that account it will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to have it decreed as is so welcome nowadays that philosophy itself is criticism and critical science and nothing else whatever though this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the positivists of france and germany and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste of kant let us call to mind the titles of his principal works our new philosophers will say notwithstanding that critics are instruments of the philosopher and just on that account as instruments they are far from being philosophers themselves even the great chinaman of konigsberg was only a great critic i insist upon it that people finally cease confounding philosophical workers and in general scientific men with philosophers that precisely here one should strictly give each his own and not give those far too much these far too little it may be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself should have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants the scientific workers of philosophy remain standing and must remain standing he himself must perhaps have been critic and dogmatist and historian and besides poet and collector and traveler and riddle reader and moralist and seer and free spirit and almost everything in order to traverse the whole range of human values and estimations and that he may be able with a variety of eyes and consciences to look from a height to any distance from a depth up to any height from a nook into any expanse but all these are only preliminary conditions for his task this task itself demands something else it requires him to create values the philosophical workers after the excellent pattern of kant and hegel have to fix and formalize some great existing body of valuations that is to say former determinations of value creations of value which have become prevalent and are for a time called truths whether in the domain of the logical the political moral or the artistic it is for these investigators to make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto conspicuous conceivable intelligible and manageable to shorten everything long even time itself and to subjugate the entire past an immense and wonderful task in the carrying out of which all refined pride all tenacious will can surely find satisfaction the real philosophers however are commanders and law givers they say thus shall it be they determine first the whither and the why of mankind and thereby set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers and all subjugators of the past they grasp at the future with a creative hand and whatever is and was becomes for them thereby a means an instrument and a hammer their knowing is creating their creating is a law giving their will to truth is will to power are there at present such philosophers have there ever been such philosophers must there not be such philosophers some day it is always more obvious to me that the philosopher as a man indispensable for the morrow and the day after the morrow has ever found himself and has been obliged to find himself in contradiction to the day in which he lives his enemy has always been the ideal of his day hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one calls philosophers who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom but rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators have found their mission their hard involuntary imperative mission in the end however the greatness of their mission in being the bad conscience of their age in putting the vivisector s knife to the breast of the very virtues of their age they have betrayed their own secret it has been for the sake of a new greatness of man a new untrodden path to his aggrandizement they have always disclosed how much hypocrisy indolence self indulgence and self neglect how much falsehood was concealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality how much virtue was outlived they have always said we must remove hence to where you are least at home in the face of a world of modern ideas which would like to confine every one in a corner in a specialty a philosopher if there could be philosophers nowadays would be compelled to place the greatness of man the conception of greatness precisely in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness in his all roundness he would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety of that which a man could bear and take upon himself according to the extent to which a man could stretch his responsibility nowadays the taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will nothing is so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently in the ideal of the philosopher strength of will sternness and capacity for prolonged resolution must specially be included in the conception of greatness with as good a right as the opposite doctrine with its ideal of a silly renouncing humble selfless humanity was suited to an opposite age such as the sixteenth century which suffered from its accumulated energy of will and from the wildest torrents and floods of selfishness in the time of socrates among men only of worn out instincts old conservative athenians who let themselves go for the sake of happiness as they said for the sake of pleasure as their conduct indicated and who had continually on their lips the old pompous words to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led irony was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul the wicked socratic assurance of the old physician and plebeian who cut ruthlessly into his own flesh as into the flesh and heart of the noble with a look that said plainly enough do not dissemble before me here we are equal at present on the contrary when throughout europe the herding animal alone attains to honours and dispenses honours when equality of right can too readily be transformed into equality in wrong i mean to say into general war against everything rare strange and privileged against the higher man the higher soul the higher duty the higher responsibility the creative plenipotence and lordliness at present it belongs to the conception of greatness to be noble to wish to be apart to be capable of being different to stand alone to have to live by personal initiative and the philosopher will betray something of his own ideal when he asserts he shall be the greatest who can be the most solitary the most concealed the most divergent the man beyond good and evil the master of his virtues and of super abundance of will precisely this shall be called greatness as diversified as can be entire as ample as can be full and to ask once more the question is greatness possible nowadays it is difficult to learn what a philosopher is because it cannot be taught one must know it by experience or one should have the pride not to know it the fact that at present people all talk of things of which they cannot have any experience is true more especially and unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical matters the very few know them are permitted to know them and all popular ideas about them are false thus for instance the truly philosophical combination of a bold exuberant spirituality which runs at presto pace and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no false step is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own experience and therefore should any one speak of it in their presence it is incredible to them they conceive of every necessity as troublesome as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating almost as a trouble and often enough as worthy of the sweat of the noble but not at all as something easy and divine closely related to dancing and exuberance to think and to take a matter seriously arduously that is one and the same thing to them such only has been their experience artists have here perhaps a finer intuition they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything arbitrarily and everything of necessity their feeling of freedom of subtlety of power of creatively fixing disposing and shaping reaches its climax in short that necessity and freedom of will are then the same thing with them there is in fine a gradation of rank in psychical states to which the gradation of rank in the problems corresponds and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them without being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality of what use is it for nimble everyday intellects or clumsy honest mechanics and empiricists to press in their plebeian ambition close to such problems and as it were into this holy of holies as so often happens nowadays but coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets this is provided for in the primary law of things the doors remain closed to those intruders though they may dash and break their heads thereon people have always to be born to a high station or more definitely they have to be bred for it a person has only a right to philosophy taking the word in its higher significance in virtue of his descent the ancestors the blood decide here also many generations must have prepared the way for the coming of the philosopher each of his virtues must have been separately acquired nurtured transmitted and embodied not only the bold easy delicate course and current of his thoughts but above all the readiness for great responsibilities the majesty of ruling glance and contemning look the feeling of separation from the multitude with their duties and virtues the kindly patronage and defense of whatever is misunderstood and calumniated be it god or devil the delight and practice of supreme justice the art of commanding the amplitude of will the lingering eye which rarely admires rarely looks up rarely loves chapter vii our virtues our virtues it is probable that we too have still our virtues although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at a little distance from us we europeans of the day after tomorrow we firstlings of the twentieth century with all our dangerous curiosity our multifariousness and art of disguising our mellow and seemingly sweetened cruelty in sense and spirit we shall presumably if we must have virtues have those only which have come to agreement with our most secret and heartfelt inclinations with our most ardent requirements well then let us look for them in our labyrinths where as we know so many things lose themselves so many things get quite lost and is there anything finer than to search for one s own virtues is it not almost to believe in one s own virtues but this believing in one s own virtues is it not practically the same as what was formerly called one s good conscience that long respectable pigtail of an idea which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads and often enough also behind their understandings it seems therefore that however little we may imagine ourselves to be old fashioned and grandfatherly respectable in other respects in one thing we are nevertheless the worthy grandchildren of our grandfathers we last europeans with good consciences we also still wear their pigtail ah if you only knew how soon so very soon it will be different as in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which determine the path of one planet and in certain cases suns of different colours shine around a single planet now with red light now with green and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley colours so we modern men owing to the complicated mechanism of our firmament are determined by different moralities our actions shine alternately in different colours and are seldom unequivocal and there are often cases also in which our actions are motley coloured to love one s enemies i think that has been well learnt it takes place thousands of times at present on a large and small scale indeed at times the higher and sublimer thing takes place we learn to despise when we love and precisely when we love best all of it however unconsciously without noise without ostentation with the shame and secrecy of goodness which forbids the utterance of the pompous word and the formula of virtue morality as attitude is opposed to our taste nowadays this is also an advance as it was an advance in our fathers that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their taste including the enmity and voltairean bitterness against religion and all that formerly belonged to freethinker pantomime it is the music in our conscience the dance in our spirit to which puritan litanies moral sermons and goody goodness won t chime let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment they never forgive us if they have once made a mistake before us or even with regard to us they inevitably become our instinctive calumniators and detractors even when they still remain our friends blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders the psychologists of france and where else are there still psychologists nowadays have never yet exhausted their bitter and manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise just as though in short they betray something thereby flaubert for instance the honest citizen of rouen neither saw heard nor tasted anything else in the end it was his mode of self torment and refined cruelty as this is growing wearisome i would now recommend for a change something else for a pleasure namely the unconscious astuteness with which good fat honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks they have to perform the subtle barbed jesuitical astuteness which is a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the middle class in its best moments subtler even than the understanding of its victims a repeated proof that instinct is the most intelligent of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered in short you psychologists study the philosophy of the rule in its struggle with the exception there you have a spectacle fit for gods and godlike malignity or in plainer words practise vivisection on good people on the homo bonae voluntatis on yourselves the practice of judging and condemning morally is the favourite revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so it is also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature and finally it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and becoming subtle malice spiritualises they are glad in their inmost heart that there is a standard according to which those who are over endowed with intellectual goods and privileges are equal to them they contend for the equality of all before god and almost need the belief in god for this purpose it is among them that the most powerful antagonists of atheism are found if any one were to say to them a lofty spirituality is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely moral man it would make them furious i shall take care not to say so i would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities that it is a synthesis of all qualities attributed to the merely moral man after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice perhaps during a whole series of generations that lofty spirituality is precisely the spiritualising of justice and the beneficent severity which knows that it is authorized to maintain gradations of rank in the world even among things and not only among men now that the praise of the disinterested person is so popular one must probably not without some danger get an idea of what people actually take an interest in and what are the things generally which fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men including the cultured even the learned and perhaps philosophers also if appearances do not deceive the fact thereby becomes obvious that the greater part of what interests and charms higher natures and more refined and fastidious tastes seems absolutely uninteresting to the average man if notwithstanding he perceive devotion to these interests he calls it desinteresse and wonders how it is possible to act disinterestedly there have been philosophers who could give this popular astonishment a seductive and mystical other worldly expression perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that disinterested action is very interesting and interested action provided that and love what even an action for love s sake shall be unegoistic but you fools and the praise of the self sacrificer but whoever has really offered sacrifice knows that he wanted and obtained something for it perhaps something from himself for something from himself that he relinquished here in order to have more there perhaps in general to be more or even feel himself more but this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more fastidious spirit does not like to stay for here truth has to stifle her yawns so much when she is obliged to answer and after all truth is a woman one must not use force with her it sometimes happens said a moralistic pedant and trifle retailer that i honour and respect an unselfish man not however because he is unselfish but because i think he has a right to be useful to another man at his own expense in short the question is always who he is and who the other is for instance in a person created and destined for command self denial and modest retirement instead of being virtues would be the waste of virtues so it seems to me every system of unegoistic morality which takes itself unconditionally and appeals to every one not only sins against good taste but is also an incentive to sins of omission an additional seduction under the mask of philanthropy and precisely a seduction and injury to the higher rarer and more privileged types of men moral systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the gradations of rank their presumption must be driven home to their conscience until they thoroughly understand at last that it is immoral to say that what is right for one is proper for another so said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus exhorted systems of morals to practise morality but one should not be too much in the right if one wishes to have the laughers on one s own side a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste wherever sympathy fellow suffering is preached nowadays and if i gather rightly no other religion is any longer preached let the psychologist have his ears open through all the vanity through all the noise which is natural to these preachers as to all preachers he will hear a hoarse groaning genuine note of self contempt it belongs to the overshadowing and uglifying of europe which has been on the increase for a century the first symptoms of which are already specified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of galiani to madame d epinay if it is not really the cause thereof the man of modern ideas the conceited ape is excessively dissatisfied with himself this is perfectly certain he suffers and his vanity wants him only to suffer with his fellows the hybrid european a tolerably ugly plebeian taken all in all absolutely requires a costume he needs history as a storeroom of costumes to be sure he notices that none of the costumes fit him properly he changes and changes let us look at the nineteenth century with respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades of style and also with respect to its moments of desperation on account of nothing suiting us it is in vain to get ourselves up as romantic or classical or christian or florentine or barocco or national in moribus et artibus it does not clothe us but the spirit especially the historical spirit profits even by this desperation once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested put on taken off packed up and above all studied we are the first studious age in puncto of costumes i mean as concerns morals articles of belief artistic tastes and religions we are prepared as no other age has ever been for a carnival in the grand style for the most spiritual festival laughter and arrogance for the transcendental height of supreme folly and aristophanic ridicule of the world perhaps we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here the domain where even we can still be original probably as parodists of the world s history and as god s merry andrews perhaps though nothing else of the present have a future our laughter itself may have a future the historical sense or the capacity for divining quickly the order of rank of the valuations according to which a people a community or an individual has lived the divining instinct for the relationships of these valuations for the relation of the authority of the valuations to the authority of the operating forces this historical sense which we europeans claim as our specialty has come to us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi barbarity into which europe has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes and races it is only the nineteenth century that has recognized this faculty as its sixth sense owing to this mingling the past of every form and mode of life and of cultures which were formerly closely contiguous and superimposed on one another flows forth into us modern souls our instincts now run back in all directions we ourselves are a kind of chaos in the end as we have said the spirit perceives its advantage therein by means of our semi barbarity in body and in desire we have secret access everywhere such as a noble age never had we have access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations and to every form of semi barbarity that has at any time existed on earth and in so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto has just been semi barbarity the historical sense implies almost the sense and instinct for everything the taste and tongue for everything whereby it immediately proves itself to be an ignoble sense for instance we enjoy homer once more it is perhaps our happiest acquisition that we know how to appreciate homer whom men of distinguished culture as the french of the seventeenth century like saint evremond who reproached him for his esprit vaste and even voltaire the last echo of the century cannot and could not so easily appropriate whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy the very decided yea and nay of their palate their promptly ready disgust their hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange their horror of the bad taste even of lively curiosity and in general the averseness of every distinguished and self sufficing culture to avow a new desire a dissatisfaction with its own condition or an admiration of what is strange all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards the best things of the world which are not their property or could not become their prey and no faculty is more unintelligible to such men than just this historical sense with its truckling plebeian curiosity the case is not different with shakespeare that marvelous spanish moorish saxon synthesis of taste over whom an ancient athenian of the circle of aeschylus would have half killed himself with laughter or irritation but we accept precisely this wild motleyness this medley of the most delicate the most coarse and the most artificial with a secret confidence and cordiality we enjoy it as a refinement of art reserved expressly for us and allow ourselves to be as little disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the english populace in which shakespeare s art and taste lives as perhaps on the chiaja of naples where with all our senses awake we go our way enchanted and voluntarily in spite of the drain odour of the lower quarters of the town that as men of the historical sense we have our virtues is not to be disputed we are unpretentious unselfish modest brave habituated to self control and self renunciation very grateful very patient very complaisant but with all this we are perhaps not very tasteful let us finally confess it that what is most difficult for us men of the historical sense to grasp feel taste and love what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almost hostile is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every culture and art the essentially noble in works and men their moment of smooth sea and halcyon self sufficiency the goldenness and coldness which all things show that have perfected themselves perhaps our great virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to good taste at least to the very bad taste and we can only evoke in ourselves imperfectly hesitatingly and with compulsion the small short and happy godsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here and there those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power has voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinite when a super abundance of refined delight has been enjoyed by a sudden checking and petrifying by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still trembling ground proportionateness is strange to us let us confess it to ourselves our itching is really the itching for the infinite the immeasurable like the rider on his forward panting horse we let the reins fall before the infinite we modern men we semi barbarians and are only in our highest bliss when we are in most danger whether it be hedonism pessimism utilitarianism or eudaemonism all those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according to pleasure and pain that is according to accompanying circumstances and secondary considerations are plausible modes of thought and naivetes which every one conscious of creative powers and an artist s conscience will look down upon with scorn though not without sympathy sympathy for you to be sure that is not sympathy as you understand it it is not sympathy for social distress for society with its sick and misfortuned for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie on the ground around us still less is it sympathy for the grumbling vexed revolutionary slave classes who strive after power they call it freedom our sympathy is a loftier and further sighted sympathy we see how man dwarfs himself how you dwarf him and there are moments when we view your sympathy with an indescribable anguish when we resist it when we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kind of levity you want if possible and there is not a more foolish if possible to do away with suffering and we it really seems that we would rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been well being as you understand it is certainly not a goal it seems to us an end a condition which at once renders man ludicrous and contemptible and makes his destruction desirable the discipline of suffering of great suffering know ye not that it is only this discipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto the tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it its energy its shuddering in view of rack and ruin its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing enduring interpreting and exploiting misfortune and whatever depth mystery disguise spirit artifice or greatness has been bestowed upon the soul has it not been bestowed through suffering through the discipline of great suffering in man creature and creator are united in man there is not only matter shred excess clay mire folly chaos but there is also the creator the sculptor the hardness of the hammer the divinity of the spectator and the seventh day do ye understand this contrast and that your sympathy for the creature in man applies to that which has to be fashioned bruised forged stretched roasted annealed refined to that which must necessarily suffer and is meant to suffer and our sympathy do ye not understand what our reverse sympathy applies to when it resists your sympathy as the worst of all pampering and enervation so it is sympathy against sympathy but to repeat it once more there are higher problems than the problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy and all systems of philosophy which deal only with these are naivetes we immoralists this world with which we are concerned in which we have to fear and love this almost invisible inaudible world of delicate command and delicate obedience a world of almost in every respect captious insidious sharp and tender yes it is well protected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity we are woven into a strong net and garment of duties and cannot disengage ourselves precisely here we are men of duty even we occasionally it is true we dance in our chains and betwixt our swords it is none the less true that more often we gnash our teeth under the circumstances and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot but do what we will fools and appearances say of us these are men without duty we have always fools and appearances against us honesty granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot rid ourselves we free spirits well we will labour at it with all our perversity and love and not tire of perfecting ourselves in our virtue which alone remains may its glance some day overspread like a gilded blue mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dull gloomy seriousness and if nevertheless our honesty should one day grow weary and sigh and stretch its limbs and find us too hard and would fain have it pleasanter easier and gentler like an agreeable vice let us remain hard we latest stoics and let us send to its help whatever devilry we have in us our disgust at the clumsy and undefined our nitimur in vetitum our love of adventure our sharpened and fastidious curiosity our most subtle disguised intellectual will to power and universal conquest which rambles and roves avidiously around all the realms of the future let us go with all our devils to the help of our god it is probable that people will misunderstand and mistake us on that account what does it matter they will say their honesty that is their devilry and nothing else what does it matter and even if they were right have not all gods hitherto been such sanctified re baptized devils and after all what do we know of ourselves and what the spirit that leads us wants to be called it is a question of names and how many spirits we harbour our honesty we free spirits let us be careful lest it become our vanity our ornament and ostentation our limitation our stupidity every virtue inclines to stupidity every stupidity to virtue stupid to the point of sanctity they say in russia let us be careful lest out of pure honesty we eventually become saints and bores is not life a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves one would have to believe in eternal life in order to i hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporific appliances and that virtue in my opinion has been more injured by the tediousness of its advocates than by anything else at the same time however i would not wish to overlook their general usefulness it is desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon morals and consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day become interesting but let us not be afraid things still remain today as they have always been i see no one in europe who has or discloses an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might be conducted in a dangerous captious and ensnaring manner that calamity might be involved therein observe for example the indefatigable inevitable english utilitarians how ponderously and respectably they stalk on stalk along a homeric metaphor expresses it better in the footsteps of bentham just as he had already stalked in the footsteps of the respectable helvetius no he was not a dangerous man helvetius ce senateur pococurante to use an expression of galiani no new thought nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression of an old thought not even a proper history of what has been previously thought on the subject an impossible literature taking it all in all unless one knows how to leaven it with some mischief in effect the old english vice called cant which is moral tartuffism has insinuated itself also into these moralists whom one must certainly read with an eye to their motives if one must read them concealed this time under the new form of the scientific spirit moreover there is not absent from them a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience from which a race of former puritans must naturally suffer in all their scientific tinkering with morals is not a moralist the opposite of a puritan that is to say as a thinker who regards morality as questionable as worthy of interrogation in short as a problem is moralizing not immoral in the end they all want english morality to be recognized as authoritative inasmuch as mankind or the general utility or the happiness of the greatest number no the happiness of england will be best served thereby they would like by all means to convince themselves that the striving after english happiness i mean after comfort and fashion and in the highest instance a seat in parliament is at the same time the true path of virtue in fact that in so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto it has just consisted in such striving not one of those ponderous conscience stricken herding animals who undertake to advocate the cause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare wants to have any knowledge or inkling of the facts that the general welfare is no ideal no goal no notion that can be at all grasped but is only a nostrum that what is fair to one may not at all be fair to another that the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to higher men in short that there is a distinction of rank between man and man and consequently between morality and morality they are an unassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men these utilitarian englishmen and as already remarked in so far as they are tedious one cannot think highly enough of their utility one ought even to encourage them as has been partially attempted in the following rhymes hail ye worthies barrow wheeling longer better aye revealing stiffer aye in head and knee unenraptured never jesting mediocre everlasting sans genie et sans esprit in these later ages which may be proud of their humanity there still remains so much fear so much superstition of the fear of the cruel wild beast the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of these humaner ages that even obvious truths as if by the agreement of centuries have long remained unuttered because they have the appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again i perhaps risk something when i allow such a truth to escape let others capture it again and give it so much milk of pious sentiment footnote an expression from schiller s william tell act iv scene to drink that it will lie down quiet and forgotten in its old corner one ought to learn anew about cruelty and open one s eyes one ought at last to learn impatience in order that such immodest gross errors as for instance have been fostered by ancient and modern philosophers with regard to tragedy may no longer wander about virtuously and boldly almost everything that we call higher culture is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of cruelty this is my thesis the wild beast has not been slain at all it lives it flourishes it has only been transfigured that which constitutes the painful delight of tragedy is cruelty that which operates agreeably in so called tragic sympathy and at the basis even of everything sublime up to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics obtains its sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty what the roman enjoys in the arena the christian in the ecstasies of the cross the spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake or of the bull fight the present day japanese who presses his way to the tragedy the workman of the parisian suburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutions the wagnerienne who with unhinged will undergoes the performance of tristan and isolde what all these enjoy and strive with mysterious ardour to drink in is the philtre of the great circe cruelty here to be sure we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of former times which could only teach with regard to cruelty that it originated at the sight of the suffering of others there is an abundant super abundant enjoyment even in one s own suffering in causing one s own suffering and wherever man has allowed himself to be persuaded to self denial in the religious sense or to self mutilation as among the phoenicians and ascetics or in general to desensualisation decarnalisation and contrition to puritanical repentance spasms to vivisection of conscience and to pascal like sacrifizia dell intelleto he is secretly allured and impelled forwards by his cruelty by the dangerous thrill of cruelty towards himself finally let us consider that even the seeker of knowledge operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty in that he compels his spirit to perceive against its own inclination and often enough against the wishes of his heart he forces it to say nay where he would like to affirm love and adore indeed every instance of taking a thing profoundly and fundamentally is a violation an intentional injuring of the fundamental will of the spirit which instinctively aims at appearance and superficiality even in every desire for knowledge there is a drop of cruelty perhaps what i have said here about a fundamental will of the spirit may not be understood without further details i may be allowed a word of explanation that imperious something which is popularly called the spirit wishes to be master internally and externally and to feel itself master it has the will of a multiplicity for a simplicity a binding taming imperious and essentially ruling will its requirements and capacities here are the same as those assigned by physiologists to everything that lives grows and multiplies the power of the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong tendency to assimilate the new to the old to simplify the manifold to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory just as it arbitrarily re underlines makes prominent and falsifies for itself certain traits and lines in the foreign elements in every portion of the outside world its object thereby is the incorporation of new experiences the assortment of new things in the old arrangements in short growth or more properly the feeling of growth the feeling of increased power is its object this same will has at its service an apparently opposed impulse of the spirit a suddenly adopted preference of ignorance of arbitrary shutting out a closing of windows an inner denial of this or that a prohibition to approach a sort of defensive attitude against much that is knowable a contentment with obscurity with the shutting in horizon an acceptance and approval of ignorance as that which is all necessary according to the degree of its appropriating power its digestive power to speak figuratively and in fact the spirit resembles a stomach more than anything else here also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be deceived perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is not so and so but is only allowed to pass as such a delight in uncertainty and ambiguity an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary out of the way narrowness and mystery of the too near of the foreground of the magnified the diminished the misshapen the beautified an enjoyment of the arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power finally in this connection there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to deceive other spirits and dissemble before them the constant pressing and straining of a creating shaping changeable power the spirit enjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises it enjoys also its feeling of security therein it is precisely by its protean arts that it is best protected and concealed counter to this propensity for appearance for simplification for a disguise for a cloak in short for an outside for every outside is a cloak there operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge which takes and insists on taking things profoundly variously and thoroughly as a kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste which every courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself provided as it ought to be that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for introspection and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe words he will say there is something cruel in the tendency of my spirit let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not so in fact it would sound nicer if instead of our cruelty perhaps our extravagant honesty were talked about whispered about and glorified we free very free spirits and some day perhaps such will actually be our posthumous glory meanwhile for there is plenty of time until then we should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in such florid and fringed moral verbiage our whole former work has just made us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance they are beautiful glistening jingling festive words honesty love of truth love of wisdom sacrifice for knowledge heroism of the truthful there is something in them that makes one s heart swell with pride but we anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the secrecy of an anchorite s conscience that this worthy parade of verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment frippery and gold dust of unconscious human vanity and that even under such flattering colour and repainting the terrible original text homo natura must again be recognized in effect to translate man back again into nature to master the many vain and visionary interpretations and subordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over the eternal original text homo natura to bring it about that man shall henceforth stand before man as he now hardened by the discipline of science stands before the other forms of nature with fearless oedipus eyes and stopped ulysses ears deaf to the enticements of old metaphysical bird catchers who have piped to him far too long thou art more thou art higher thou hast a different origin this may be a strange and foolish task but that it is a task who can deny why did we choose it this foolish task or to put the question differently why knowledge at all every one will ask us about this and thus pressed we who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times have not found and cannot find any better answer learning alters us it does what all nourishment does that does not merely conserve as the physiologist knows but at the bottom of our souls quite down below there is certainly something unteachable a granite of spiritual fate of predetermined decision and answer to predetermined chosen questions in each cardinal problem there speaks an unchangeable i am this a thinker cannot learn anew about man and woman for instance but can only learn fully he can only follow to the end what is fixed about them in himself occasionally we find certain solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us perhaps they are henceforth called convictions later on one sees in them only footsteps to self knowledge guide posts to the problem which we ourselves are or more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody our spiritual fate the unteachable in us quite down below in view of this liberal compliment which i have just paid myself permission will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths about woman as she is provided that it is known at the outset how literally they are merely my truths woman wishes to be independent and therefore she begins to enlighten men about woman as she is this is one of the worst developments of the general uglifying of europe for what must these clumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self exposure bring to light woman has so much cause for shame in woman there is so much pedantry superficiality schoolmasterliness petty presumption unbridledness and indiscretion concealed study only woman s behaviour towards children which has really been best restrained and dominated hitherto by the fear of man alas if ever the eternally tedious in woman she has plenty of it is allowed to venture forth if she begins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and art of charming of playing of frightening away sorrow of alleviating and taking easily if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable desires female voices are already raised which by saint aristophanes make one afraid with medical explicitness it is stated in a threatening manner what woman first and last requires from man is it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to be scientific enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men s affair men s gift we remained therewith among ourselves and in the end in view of all that women write about woman we may well have considerable doubt as to whether woman really desires enlightenment about herself and can desire it if woman does not thereby seek a new ornament for herself i believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally feminine why then she wishes to make herself feared perhaps she thereby wishes to get the mastery but she does not want truth what does woman care for truth from the very first nothing is more foreign more repugnant or more hostile to woman than truth her great art is falsehood her chief concern is appearance and beauty let us confess it we men we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in woman we who have the hard task and for our recreation gladly seek the company of beings under whose hands glances and delicate follies our seriousness our gravity and profundity appear almost like follies to us finally i ask the question did a woman herself ever acknowledge profundity in a woman s mind or justice in a woman s heart and is it not true that on the whole woman has hitherto been most despised by woman herself and not at all by us we men desire that woman should not continue to compromise herself by enlightening us just as it was man s care and the consideration for woman when the church decreed mulier taceat in ecclesia it was to the benefit of woman when napoleon gave the too eloquent madame de stael to understand mulier taceat in politicis and in my opinion he is a true friend of woman who calls out to women today mulier taceat de mulierel it betrays corruption of the instincts apart from the fact that it betrays bad taste when a woman refers to madame roland or madame de stael or monsieur george sand as though something were proved thereby in favour of woman as she is among men these are the three comical women as they are nothing more and just the best involuntary counter arguments against feminine emancipation and autonomy stupidity in the kitchen woman as cook the terrible thoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of the house is managed woman does not understand what food means and she insists on being cook if woman had been a thinking creature she should certainly as cook for thousands of years have discovered the most important physiological facts and should likewise have got possession of the healing art through bad female cooks through the entire lack of reason in the kitchen the development of mankind has been longest retarded and most interfered with even today matters are very little better a word to high school girls there are turns and casts of fancy there are sentences little handfuls of words in which a whole culture a whole society suddenly crystallises itself among these is the incidental remark of madame de lambert to her son mon ami ne vous permettez jamais que des folies qui vous feront grand plaisir the motherliest and wisest remark by the way that was ever addressed to a son i have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what dante and goethe believed about woman the former when he sang ella guardava suso ed io in lei and the latter when he interpreted it the eternally feminine draws us aloft for this is just what she believes of the eternally masculine seven apophthegms for women how the longest ennui flees when a man comes to our knees age alas and science staid furnish even weak virtue aid sombre garb and silence meet dress for every dame discreet whom i thank when in my bliss god and my good tailoress young a flower decked cavern home old a dragon thence doth roam noble title leg that s fine man as well oh were he mine speech in brief and sense in mass slippery for the jenny ass a woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds which losing their way have come down among them from an elevation as something delicate fragile wild strange sweet and animating but as something also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away to be mistaken in the fundamental problem of man and woman to deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally hostile tension to dream here perhaps of equal rights equal training equal claims and obligations that is a typical sign of shallow mindedness and a thinker who has proved himself shallow at this dangerous spot shallow in instinct may generally be regarded as suspicious nay more as betrayed as discovered he will probably prove too short for all fundamental questions of life future as well as present and will be unable to descend into any of the depths on the other hand a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires and has also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and harshness and easily confounded with them can only think of woman as orientals do he must conceive of her as a possession as confinable property as a being predestined for service and accomplishing her mission therein he must take his stand in this matter upon the immense rationality of asia upon the superiority of the instinct of asia as the greeks did formerly those best heirs and scholars of asia who as is well known with their increasing culture and amplitude of power from homer to the time of pericles became gradually stricter towards woman in short more oriental how necessary how logical even how humanely desirable this was let us consider for ourselves the weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so much respect by men as at present this belongs to the tendency and fundamental taste of democracy in the same way as disrespectfulness to old age what wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of this respect they want more they learn to make claims the tribute of respect is at last felt to be well nigh galling rivalry for rights indeed actual strife itself would be preferred in a word woman is losing modesty and let us immediately add that she is also losing taste she is unlearning to fear man but the woman who unlearns to fear sacrifices her most womanly instincts that woman should venture forward when the fear inspiring quality in man or more definitely the man in man is no longer either desired or fully developed is reasonable enough and also intelligible enough what is more difficult to understand is that precisely thereby woman deteriorates this is what is happening nowadays let us not deceive ourselves about it wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit woman strives for the economic and legal independence of a clerk woman as clerkess is inscribed on the portal of the modern society which is in course of formation while she thus appropriates new rights aspires to be master and inscribes progress of woman on her flags and banners the very opposite realises itself with terrible obviousness woman retrogrades since the french revolution the influence of woman in europe has declined in proportion as she has increased her rights and claims and the emancipation of woman insofar as it is desired and demanded by women themselves and not only by masculine shallow pates thus proves to be a remarkable symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly instincts there is stupidity in this movement an almost masculine stupidity of which a well reared woman who is always a sensible woman might be heartily ashamed to lose the intuition as to the ground upon which she can most surely achieve victory to neglect exercise in the use of her proper weapons to let herself go before man perhaps even to the book where formerly she kept herself in control and in refined artful humility to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man s faith in a veiled fundamentally different ideal in woman something eternally necessarily feminine to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved cared for protected and indulged like some delicate strangely wild and often pleasant domestic animal the clumsy and indignant collection of everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of woman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and still entails as though slavery were a counter argument and not rather a condition of every higher culture of every elevation of culture what does all this betoken if not a disintegration of womanly instincts a defeminising certainly there are enough of idiotic friends and corrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex who advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner and to imitate all the stupidities from which man in europe european manliness suffers who would like to lower woman to general culture indeed even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics here and there they wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers as though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to a profound and godless man almost everywhere her nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music our latest german music and she is daily being made more hysterical and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function that of bearing robust children they wish to cultivate her in general still more and intend as they say to make the weaker sex strong by culture as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that the cultivating of mankind and his weakening that is to say the weakening dissipating and languishing of his force of will have always kept pace with one another and that the most powerful and influential women in the world and lastly the mother of napoleon had just to thank their force of will and not their schoolmasters for their power and ascendancy over men that which inspires respect in woman and often enough fear also is her nature which is more natural than that of man her genuine carnivora like cunning flexibility her tiger claws beneath the glove her naivete in egoism her untrainableness and innate wildness the incomprehensibleness extent and deviation of her desires and virtues that which in spite of fear excites one s sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat woman is that she seems more afflicted more vulnerable more necessitous of love and more condemned to disillusionment than any other creature fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man has hitherto stood in the presence of woman always with one foot already in tragedy which rends while it delights what and all that is now to be at an end and the disenchantment of woman is in progress the tediousness of woman is slowly evolving oh europe europe we know the horned animal which was always most attractive to thee from which danger is ever again threatening thee thy old fable might once more become history an immense stupidity might once again overmaster thee and carry thee away and no god concealed beneath it no only an idea a modern idea chapter viii peoples and countries i heard once again for the first time richard wagner s overture to the mastersinger it is a piece of magnificent gorgeous heavy latter day art which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music as still living in order that it may be understood it is an honour to germans that such a pride did not miscalculate what flavours and forces what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it it impresses us at one time as ancient at another time as foreign bitter and too modern it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional it is not infrequently roguish still oftener rough and coarse it has fire and courage and at the same time the loose dun coloured skin of fruits which ripen too late it flows broad and full and suddenly there is a moment of inexplicable hesitation like a gap that opens between cause and effect an oppression that makes us dream almost a nightmare but already it broadens and widens anew the old stream of delight the most manifold delight of old and new happiness including especially the joy of the artist in himself which he refuses to conceal his astonished happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here employed the new newly acquired imperfectly tested expedients of art which he apparently betrays to us all in all however no beauty no south nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky nothing of grace no dance hardly a will to logic a certain clumsiness even which is also emphasized as though the artist wished to say to us it is part of my intention a cumbersome drapery something arbitrarily barbaric and ceremonious a flirring of learned and venerable conceits and witticisms something german in the best and worst sense of the word something in the german style manifold formless and inexhaustible a certain german potency and super plenitude of soul which is not afraid to hide itself under the raffinements of decadence which perhaps feels itself most at ease there a real genuine token of the german soul which is at the same time young and aged too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity this kind of music expresses best what i think of the germans they belong to the day before yesterday and the day after tomorrow they have as yet no today we good europeans we also have hours when we allow ourselves a warm hearted patriotism a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrow views i have just given an example of it hours of national excitement of patriotic anguish and all other sorts of old fashioned floods of sentiment duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what confines its operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hours in a considerable time some in half a year others in half a lifetime according to the speed and strength with which they digest and change their material indeed i could think of sluggish hesitating races which even in our rapidly moving europe would require half a century ere they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and soil attachment and return once more to reason that is to say to good europeanism and while digressing on this possibility i happen to become an ear witness of a conversation between two old patriots they were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently spoke all the louder he has as much and knows as much philosophy as a peasant or a corps student said the one he is still innocent but what does that matter nowadays it is the age of the masses they lie on their belly before everything that is massive and so also in politicis a statesman who rears up for them a new tower of babel some monstrosity of empire and power they call great what does it matter that we more prudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old belief that it is only the great thought that gives greatness to an action or affair supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position of being obliged henceforth to practise high politics for which they were by nature badly endowed and prepared so that they would have to sacrifice their old and reliable virtues out of love to a new and doubtful mediocrity supposing a statesman were to condemn his people generally to practise politics when they have hitherto had something better to do and think about and when in the depths of their souls they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of the restlessness emptiness and noisy wranglings of the essentially politics practising nations supposing such a statesman were to stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people were to make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency were to depreciate their most radical proclivities subvert their consciences make their minds narrow and their tastes national what a statesman who should do all this which his people would have to do penance for throughout their whole future if they had a future such a statesman would be great would he undoubtedly replied the other old patriot vehemently otherwise he could not have done it it was mad perhaps to wish such a thing but perhaps everything great has been just as mad at its commencement misuse of words cried his interlocutor contradictorily strong strong strong and mad not great the old men had obviously become heated as they thus shouted their truths in each other s faces but i in my happiness and apartness considered how soon a stronger one may become master of the strong and also that there is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a nation namely in the deepening of another whether we call it civilization or humanising or progress which now distinguishes the european whether we call it simply without praise or blame by the political formula the democratic movement in europe behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by such formulas an immense physiological process goes on which is ever extending the process of the assimilation of europeans their increasing detachment from the conditions under which climatically and hereditarily united races originate their increasing independence of every definite milieu that for centuries would fain inscribe itself with equal demands on soul and body that is to say the slow emergence of an essentially super national and nomadic species of man who possesses physiologically speaking a maximum of the art and power of adaptation as his typical distinction this process of the evolving european which can be retarded in its tempo by great relapses but will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depth the still raging storm and stress of national sentiment pertains to it and also the anarchism which is appearing at present this process will probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators and panegyrists the apostles of modern ideas would least care to reckon the same new conditions under which on an average a levelling and mediocrising of man will take place a useful industrious variously serviceable and clever gregarious man are in the highest degree suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and attractive qualities for while the capacity for adaptation which is every day trying changing conditions and begins a new work with every generation almost with every decade makes the powerfulness of the type impossible while the collective impression of such future europeans will probably be that of numerous talkative weak willed and very handy workmen who require a master a commander as they require their daily bread while therefore the democratising of europe will tend to the production of a type prepared for slavery in the most subtle sense of the term the strong man will necessarily in individual and exceptional cases become stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever been before owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling owing to the immense variety of practice art and disguise i meant to say that the democratising of europe is at the same time an involuntary arrangement for the rearing of tyrants taking the word in all its meanings even in its most spiritual sense i hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the constellation hercules and i hope that the men on this earth will do like the sun and we foremost we good europeans there was a time when it was customary to call germans deep by way of distinction but now that the most successful type of new germanism is covetous of quite other honours and perhaps misses smartness in all that has depth it is almost opportune and patriotic to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that commendation in short whether german depth is not at bottom something different and worse and something from which thank god we are on the point of successfully ridding ourselves let us try then to relearn with regard to german depth the only thing necessary for the purpose is a little vivisection of the german soul the german soul is above all manifold varied in its source aggregated and super imposed rather than actually built this is owing to its origin a german who would embolden himself to assert two souls alas dwell in my breast would make a bad guess at the truth or more correctly he would come far short of the truth about the number of souls as a people made up of the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races perhaps even with a preponderance of the pre aryan element as the people of the centre in every sense of the term the germans are more intangible more ample more contradictory more unknown more incalculable more surprising and even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves they escape definition and are thereby alone the despair of the french it is characteristic of the germans that the question what is german never dies out among them kotzebue certainly knew his germans well enough we are known they cried jubilantly to him but sand also thought he knew them jean paul knew what he was doing when he declared himself incensed at fichte s lying but patriotic flatteries and exaggerations but it is probable that goethe thought differently about germans from jean paul even though he acknowledged him to be right with regard to fichte it is a question what goethe really thought about the germans but about many things around him he never spoke explicitly and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silence probably he had good reason for it it is certain that it was not the wars of independence that made him look up more joyfully any more than it was the french revolution the event on account of which he reconstructed his faust and indeed the whole problem of man was the appearance of napoleon there are words of goethe in which he condemns with impatient severity as from a foreign land that which germans take a pride in he once defined the famous german turn of mind as indulgence towards its own and others weaknesses was he wrong it is characteristic of germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them the german soul has passages and galleries in it there are caves hiding places and dungeons therein its disorder has much of the charm of the mysterious the german is well acquainted with the bypaths to chaos and as everything loves its symbol so the german loves the clouds and all that is obscure evolving crepuscular damp and shrouded it seems to him that everything uncertain undeveloped self displacing and growing is deep the german himself does not exist he is becoming he is developing himself development is therefore the essentially german discovery and hit in the great domain of philosophical formulas a ruling idea which together with german beer and german music is labouring to germanise all europe foreigners are astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conflicting nature at the basis of the german soul propounds to them riddles which hegel systematised and richard wagner has in the end set to music good natured and spiteful such a juxtaposition preposterous in the case of every other people is unfortunately only too often justified in germany one has only to live for a while among swabians to know this the clumsiness of the german scholar and his social distastefulness agree alarmingly well with his physical rope dancing and nimble boldness of which all the gods have learnt to be afraid if any one wishes to see the german soul demonstrated ad oculos let him only look at german taste at german arts and manners what boorish indifference to taste how the noblest and the commonest stand there in juxtaposition how disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution of this soul the german drags at his soul he drags at everything he experiences he digests his events badly he never gets done with them and german depth is often only a difficult hesitating digestion and just as all chronic invalids all dyspeptics like what is convenient so the german loves frankness and honesty it is so convenient to be frank and honest this confidingness this complaisance this showing the cards of german honesty is probably the most dangerous and most successful disguise which the german is up to nowadays it is his proper mephistophelean art with this he can still achieve much the german lets himself go and thereby gazes with faithful blue empty german eyes and other countries immediately confound him with his dressing gown i meant to say that let german depth be what it will among ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh at it we shall do well to continue henceforth to honour its appearance and good name and not barter away too cheaply our old reputation as a people of depth for prussian smartness and berlin wit and sand it is wise for a people to pose and let itself be regarded as profound clumsy good natured honest and foolish it might even be profound to do so finally we should do honour to our name we are not called the tiusche volk deceptive people for nothing the good old time is past it sang itself out in mozart how happy are we that his rococo still speaks to us that his good company his tender enthusiasm his childish delight in the chinese and its flourishes his courtesy of heart his longing for the elegant the amorous the tripping the tearful and his belief in the south can still appeal to something left in us ah some time or other it will be over with it but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with the intelligence and taste for beethoven for he was only the last echo of a break and transition in style and not like mozart the last echo of a great european taste which had existed for centuries beethoven is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly breaking down and a future over young soul that is always coming there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal extravagant hope the same light in which europe was bathed when it dreamed with rousseau when it danced round the tree of liberty of the revolution and finally almost fell down in adoration before napoleon but how rapidly does this very sentiment now pale how difficult nowadays is even the apprehension of this sentiment how strangely does the language of rousseau schiller shelley and byron sound to our ear in whom collectively the same fate of europe was able to speak which knew how to sing in beethoven whatever german music came afterwards belongs to romanticism that is to say to a movement which historically considered was still shorter more fleeting and more superficial than that great interlude the transition of europe from rousseau to napoleon and to the rise of democracy weber but what do we care nowadays for freischutz and oberon or marschner s hans heiling and vampyre or even wagner s tannhauser that is extinct although not yet forgotten music this whole music of romanticism besides was not noble enough was not musical enough to maintain its position anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses from the beginning it was second rate music which was little thought of by genuine musicians it was different with felix mendelssohn that halcyon master who on account of his lighter purer happier soul quickly acquired admiration and was equally quickly forgotten as the beautiful episode of german music but with regard to robert schumann who took things seriously and has been taken seriously from the first he was the last that founded a school do we not now regard it as a satisfaction a relief a deliverance that this very romanticism of schumann s has been surmounted schumann fleeing into the saxon switzerland of his soul with a half werther like half jean paul like nature assuredly not like beethoven assuredly not like byron his manfred music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of injustice schumann with his taste which was fundamentally a petty taste that is to say a dangerous propensity doubly dangerous among germans for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings going constantly apart timidly withdrawing and retiring a noble weakling who revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow from the beginning a sort of girl and noli me tangere this schumann was already merely a german event in music and no longer a european event as beethoven had been as in a still greater degree mozart had been with schumann german music was threatened with its greatest danger that of losing the voice for the soul of europe and sinking into a merely national affair what a torture are books written in german to a reader who has a third ear how indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp of sounds without tune and rhythms without dance which germans call a book and even the german who reads books how lazily how reluctantly how badly he reads how many germans know and consider it obligatory to know that there is art in every good sentence art which must be divined if the sentence is to be understood if there is a misunderstanding about its tempo for instance the sentence itself is misunderstood that one must not be doubtful about the rhythm determining syllables that one should feel the breaking of the too rigid symmetry as intentional and as a charm that one should lend a fine and patient ear to every staccato and every rubato that one should divine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs and how delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of their arrangement who among book reading germans is complaisant enough to recognize such duties and requirements and to listen to so much art and intention in language after all one just has no ear for it and so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard and the most delicate artistry is as it were squandered on the deaf these were my thoughts when i noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters in the art of prose writing have been confounded one whose words drop down hesitatingly and coldly as from the roof of a damp cave he counts on their dull sound and echo and another who manipulates his language like a flexible sword and from his arm down into his toes feels the dangerous bliss of the quivering over sharp blade which wishes to bite hiss and cut how little the german style has to do with harmony and with the ear is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselves write badly the german does not read aloud he does not read for the ear but only with his eyes he has put his ears away in the drawer for the time in antiquity when a man read which was seldom enough he read something to himself and in a loud voice they were surprised when any one read silently and sought secretly the reason of it in a loud voice that is to say with all the swellings inflections and variations of key and changes of tempo in which the ancient public world took delight the laws of the written style were then the same as those of the spoken style and these laws depended partly on the surprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx partly on the strength endurance and power of the ancient lungs in the ancient sense a period is above all a physiological whole inasmuch as it is comprised in one breath such periods as occur in demosthenes and cicero swelling twice and sinking twice and all in one breath were pleasures to the men of antiquity who knew by their own schooling how to appreciate the virtue therein the rareness and the difficulty in the deliverance of such a period we have really no right to the big period we modern men who are short of breath in every sense those ancients indeed were all of them dilettanti in speaking consequently connoisseurs consequently critics they thus brought their orators to the highest pitch in the same manner as in the last century when all italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing the virtuosoship of song and with it also the art of melody reached its elevation in germany however until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings there was properly speaking only one kind of public and approximately artistical discourse that delivered from the pulpit the preacher was the only one in germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word in what manner a sentence strikes springs rushes flows and comes to a close he alone had a conscience in his ears often enough a bad conscience for reasons are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom attained by a german or almost always too late the masterpiece of german prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of its greatest preacher the bible has hitherto been the best german book compared with luther s bible almost everything else is merely literature something which has not grown in germany and therefore has not taken and does not take root in german hearts as the bible has done there are two kinds of geniuses one which above all engenders and seeks to engender and another which willingly lets itself be fructified and brings forth and similarly among the gifted nations there are those on whom the woman s problem of pregnancy has devolved and the secret task of forming maturing and perfecting the greeks for instance were a nation of this kind and so are the french and others which have to fructify and become the cause of new modes of life like the jews the romans and in all modesty be it asked like the germans nations tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and irresistibly forced out of themselves amorous and longing for foreign races for such as let themselves be fructified and withal imperious like everything conscious of being full of generative force and consequently empowered by the grace of god these two kinds of geniuses seek each other like man and woman but they also misunderstand each other like man and woman every nation has its own tartuffery and calls that its virtue one does not know cannot know the best that is in one what europe owes to the jews many things good and bad and above all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst the grand style in morality the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands of infinite significations the whole romanticism and sublimity of moral questionableness and consequently just the most attractive ensnaring and exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to life in the aftersheen of which the sky of our european culture its evening sky now glows perhaps glows out for this we artists among the spectators and philosophers are grateful to the jews it must be taken into the bargain if various clouds and disturbances in short slight attacks of stupidity pass over the spirit of a people that suffers and wants to suffer from national nervous fever and political ambition for instance among present day germans there is alternately the anti french folly the anti semitic folly the anti polish folly the christian romantic folly the wagnerian folly the teutonic folly the prussian folly just look at those poor historians the sybels and treitschkes and their closely bandaged heads and whatever else these little obscurations of the german spirit and conscience may be called may it be forgiven me that i too when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground did not remain wholly exempt from the disease but like every one else began to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern me the first symptom of political infection about the jews for instance listen to the following i have never yet met a german who was favourably inclined to the jews and however decided the repudiation of actual anti semitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men this prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the sentiment itself but only against its dangerous excess and especially against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of sentiment on this point we must not deceive ourselves that germany has amply sufficient jews that the german stomach the german blood has difficulty and will long have difficulty in disposing only of this quantity of jew as the italian the frenchman and the englishman have done by means of a stronger digestion that is the unmistakable declaration and language of a general instinct to which one must listen and according to which one must act let no more jews come in and shut the doors especially towards the east also towards austria thus commands the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and uncertain so that it could be easily wiped out easily extinguished by a stronger race the jews however are beyond all doubt the strongest toughest and purest race at present living in europe they know how to succeed even under the worst conditions in fact better than under favourable ones by means of virtues of some sort which one would like nowadays to label as vices owing above all to a resolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before modern ideas they alter only when they do alter in the same way that the russian empire makes its conquest as an empire that has plenty of time and is not of yesterday namely according to the principle as slowly as possible a thinker who has the future of europe at heart will in all his perspectives concerning the future calculate upon the jews as he will calculate upon the russians as above all the surest and likeliest factors in the great play and battle of forces that which is at present called a nation in europe and is really rather a res facta than nata indeed sometimes confusingly similar to a res ficta et picta is in every case something evolving young easily displaced and not yet a race much less such a race aere perennus as the jews are such nations should most carefully avoid all hot headed rivalry and hostility it is certain that the jews if they desired or if they were driven to it as the anti semites seem to wish could now have the ascendancy nay literally the supremacy over europe that they are not working and planning for that end is equally certain meanwhile they rather wish and desire even somewhat importunely to be insorbed and absorbed by europe they long to be finally settled authorized and respected somewhere and wish to put an end to the nomadic life to the wandering jew and one should certainly take account of this impulse and tendency and make advances to it it possibly betokens a mitigation of the jewish instincts for which purpose it would perhaps be useful and fair to banish the anti semitic bawlers out of the country one should make advances with all prudence and with selection pretty much as the english nobility do it stands to reason that the more powerful and strongly marked types of new germanism could enter into relation with the jews with the least hesitation for instance the nobleman officer from the prussian border it would be interesting in many ways to see whether the genius for money and patience and especially some intellect and intellectuality sadly lacking in the place referred to could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of commanding and obeying for both of which the country in question has now a classic reputation but here it is expedient to break off my festal discourse and my sprightly teutonomania for i have already reached my serious topic the european problem as i understand it the rearing of a new ruling caste for europe they are not a philosophical race the english bacon represents an attack on the philosophical spirit generally hobbes hume and locke an abasement and a depreciation of the idea of a philosopher for more than a century it was against hume that kant uprose and raised himself it was locke of whom schelling rightly said je meprise locke in the struggle against the english mechanical stultification of the world hegel and schopenhauer along with goethe were of one accord the two hostile brother geniuses in philosophy who pushed in different directions towards the opposite poles of german thought and thereby wronged each other as only brothers will do what is lacking in england and has always been lacking that half actor and rhetorician knew well enough the absurd muddle head carlyle who sought to conceal under passionate grimaces what he knew about himself namely what was lacking in carlyle real power of intellect real depth of intellectual perception in short philosophy it is characteristic of such an unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to christianity they need its discipline for moralizing and humanizing the englishman more gloomy sensual headstrong and brutal than the german is for that very reason as the baser of the two also the most pious he has all the more need of christianity to finer nostrils this english christianity itself has still a characteristic english taint of spleen and alcoholic excess for which owing to good reasons it is used as an antidote the finer poison to neutralize the coarser a finer form of poisoning is in fact a step in advance with coarse mannered people a step towards spiritualization the english coarseness and rustic demureness is still most satisfactorily disguised by christian pantomime and by praying and psalm singing or more correctly it is thereby explained and differently expressed and for the herd of drunkards and rakes who formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of methodism and more recently as the salvation army a penitential fit may really be the relatively highest manifestation of humanity to which they can be elevated so much may reasonably be admitted that however which offends even in the humanest englishman is his lack of music to speak figuratively and also literally he has neither rhythm nor dance in the movements of his soul and body indeed not even the desire for rhythm and dance for music listen to him speaking look at the most beautiful englishwoman walking in no country on earth are there more beautiful doves and swans finally listen to them singing but i ask too much there are truths which are best recognized by mediocre minds because they are best adapted for them there are truths which only possess charms and seductive power for mediocre spirits one is pushed to this probably unpleasant conclusion now that the influence of respectable but mediocre englishmen i may mention darwin john stuart mill and herbert spencer begins to gain the ascendancy in the middle class region of european taste indeed who could doubt that it is a useful thing for such minds to have the ascendancy for a time it would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently soaring minds as specially qualified for determining and collecting many little common facts and deducing conclusions from them as exceptions they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards those who are the rules after all they have more to do than merely to perceive in effect they have to be something new they have to signify something new they have to represent new values the gulf between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater and also more mysterious than one thinks the capable man in the grand style the creator will possibly have to be an ignorant person while on the other hand for scientific discoveries like those of darwin a certain narrowness aridity and industrious carefulness in short something english may not be unfavourable for arriving at them finally let it not be forgotten that the english with their profound mediocrity brought about once before a general depression of european intelligence what is called modern ideas or the ideas of the eighteenth century or french ideas that consequently against which the german mind rose up with profound disgust is of english origin there is no doubt about it the french were only the apes and actors of these ideas their best soldiers and likewise alas their first and profoundest victims for owing to the diabolical anglomania of modern ideas the ame francais has in the end become so thin and emaciated that at present one recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries its profound passionate strength its inventive excellency almost with disbelief one must however maintain this verdict of historical justice in a determined manner and defend it against present prejudices and appearances the european noblesse of sentiment taste and manners taking the word in every high sense is the work and invention of france the european ignobleness the plebeianism of modern ideas is england s work and invention even at present france is still the seat of the most intellectual and refined culture of europe it is still the high school of taste but one must know how to find this france of taste he who belongs to it keeps himself well concealed they may be a small number in whom it lives and is embodied besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon the strongest legs in part fatalists hypochondriacs invalids in part persons over indulged over refined such as have the ambition to conceal themselves they have all something in common they keep their ears closed in presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic bourgeois in fact a besotted and brutalized france at present sprawls in the foreground it recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste and at the same time of self admiration at the funeral of victor hugo there is also something else common to them a predilection to resist intellectual germanizing and a still greater inability to do so in this france of intellect which is also a france of pessimism schopenhauer has perhaps become more at home and more indigenous than he has ever been in germany not to speak of heinrich heine who has long ago been re incarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrists of paris or of hegel who at present in the form of taine the first of living historians exercises an almost tyrannical influence as regards richard wagner however the more french music learns to adapt itself to the actual needs of the ame moderne the more will it wagnerite one can safely predict that beforehand it is already taking place sufficiently there are however three things which the french can still boast of with pride as their heritage and possession and as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority in europe in spite of all voluntary or involuntary germanizing and vulgarizing of taste firstly the capacity for artistic emotion for devotion to form for which the expression l art pour l art along with numerous others has been invented such capacity has not been lacking in france for three centuries and owing to its reverence for the small number it has again and again made a sort of chamber music of literature possible which is sought for in vain elsewhere in europe the second thing whereby the french can lay claim to a superiority over europe is their ancient many sided moralistic culture owing to which one finds on an average even in the petty romanciers of the newspapers and chance boulevardiers de paris a psychological sensitiveness and curiosity of which for example one has no conception to say nothing of the thing itself in germany the germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisite thereto which as we have said france has not grudged those who call the germans naive on that account give them commendation for a defect as the opposite of the german inexperience and innocence in voluptate psychologica which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness of german intercourse and as the most successful expression of genuine french curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate thrills henri beyle may be noted that remarkable anticipatory and forerunning man who with a napoleonic tempo traversed his europe in fact several centuries of the european soul as a surveyor and discoverer thereof it has required two generations to overtake him one way or other to divine long afterwards some of the riddles that perplexed and enraptured him this strange epicurean and man of interrogation the last great psychologist of france there is yet a third claim to superiority in the french character there is a successful half way synthesis of the north and south which makes them comprehend many things and enjoins upon them other things which an englishman can never comprehend their temperament turned alternately to and from the south in which from time to time the provencal and ligurian blood froths over preserves them from the dreadful northern grey in grey from sunless conceptual spectrism and from poverty of blood our german infirmity of taste for the excessive prevalence of which at the present moment blood and iron that is to say high politics has with great resolution been prescribed according to a dangerous healing art which bids me wait and wait but not yet hope there is also still in france a pre understanding and ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men who are too comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism and know how to love the south when in the north and the north when in the south the born midlanders the good europeans for them bizet has made music this latest genius who has seen a new beauty and seduction who has discovered a piece of the south in music i hold that many precautions should be taken against german music suppose a person loves the south as i love it as a great school of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills as a boundless solar profusion and effulgence which o erspreads a sovereign existence believing in itself well such a person will learn to be somewhat on his guard against german music because in injuring his taste anew it will also injure his health anew such a southerner a southerner not by origin but by belief if he should dream of the future of music must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the north and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper mightier and perhaps more perverse and mysterious music a super german music which does not fade pale and die away as all german music does at the sight of the blue wanton sea and the mediterranean clearness of sky a super european music which holds its own even in presence of the brown sunsets of the desert whose soul is akin to the palm tree and can be at home and can roam with big beautiful lonely beasts of prey i could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew nothing more of good and evil only that here and there perhaps some sailor s home sickness some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might sweep lightly over it an art which from the far distance would see the colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible moral world fleeing towards it and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to receive such belated fugitives owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality craze has induced and still induces among the nations of europe owing also to the short sighted and hasty handed politicians who with the help of this craze are at present in power and do not suspect to what extent the disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude policy owing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable at present the most unmistakable signs that europe wishes to be one are now overlooked or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted with all the more profound and large minded men of this century the real general tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the way for that new synthesis and tentatively to anticipate the european of the future only in their simulations or in their weaker moments in old age perhaps did they belong to the fatherlands they only rested from themselves when they became patriots i think of such men as napoleon goethe beethoven stendhal heinrich heine schopenhauer it must not be taken amiss if i also count richard wagner among them about whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselves still less of course by the unseemly noise with which he is now resisted and opposed in france the fact remains nevertheless that richard wagner and the later french romanticism of the forties are most closely and intimately related to one another they are akin fundamentally akin in all the heights and depths of their requirements it is europe the one europe whose soul presses urgently and longingly outwards and upwards in their multifarious and boisterous art whither into a new light towards a new sun but who would attempt to express accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could not express distinctly it is certain that the same storm and stress tormented them that they sought in the same manner these last great seekers all of them steeped in literature to their eyes and ears the first artists of universal literary culture for the most part even themselves writers poets intermediaries and blenders of the arts and the senses wagner as musician is reckoned among painters as poet among musicians as artist generally among actors all of them fanatics for expression at any cost i specially mention delacroix the nearest related to wagner all of them great discoverers in the realm of the sublime also of the loathsome and dreadful still greater discoverers in effect in display in the art of the show shop all of them talented far beyond their genius out and out virtuosi with mysterious accesses to all that seduces allures constrains and upsets born enemies of logic and of the straight line hankering after the strange the exotic the monstrous the crooked and the self contradictory as men tantaluses of the will plebeian parvenus who knew themselves to be incapable of a noble tempo or of a lento in life and action think of balzac for instance unrestrained workers almost destroying themselves by work antinomians and rebels in manners ambitious and insatiable without equilibrium and enjoyment all of them finally shattering and sinking down at the christian cross and with right and reason for who of them would have been sufficiently profound and sufficiently original for an anti christian philosophy on the whole a boldly daring splendidly overbearing high flying and aloft up dragging class of higher men who had first to teach their century and it is the century of the masses the conception higher man let the german friends of richard wagner advise together as to whether there is anything purely german in the wagnerian art or whether its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from super german sources and impulses in which connection it may not be underrated how indispensable paris was to the development of his type which the strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most decisive time and how the whole style of his proceedings of his self apostolate could only perfect itself in sight of the french socialistic original on a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be found to the honour of richard wagner s german nature that he has acted in everything with more strength daring severity and elevation than a nineteenth century frenchman could have done owing to the circumstance that we germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the french perhaps even the most remarkable creation of richard wagner is not only at present but for ever inaccessible incomprehensible and inimitable to the whole latter day latin race the figure of siegfried that very free man who is probably far too free too hard too cheerful too healthy too anti catholic for the taste of old and mellow civilized nations he may even have been a sin against romanticism this anti latin siegfried well wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old sad days when anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed into politics he began with the religious vehemence peculiar to him to preach at least the way to rome if not to walk therein that these last words may not be misunderstood i will call to my aid a few powerful rhymes which will even betray to less delicate ears what i mean what i mean counter to the last wagner and his parsifal music is this our mode from german heart came this vexed ululating from german body this self lacerating is ours this priestly hand dilation this incense fuming exaltation is ours this faltering falling shambling this quite uncertain ding dong dangling this sly nun ogling ave hour bell ringing this wholly false enraptured heaven o erspringing is this our mode think well ye still wait for admission for what ye hear is rome rome s faith by intuition chapter ix what is noble every elevation of the type man has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always be a society believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings and requiring slavery in some form or other without the pathos of distance such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classes out of the constant out looking and down looking of the ruling caste on subordinates and instruments and out of their equally constant practice of obeying and commanding of keeping down and keeping at a distance that other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen the longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself the formation of ever higher rarer further more extended more comprehensive states in short just the elevation of the type man the continued self surmounting of man to use a moral formula in a supermoral sense to be sure one must not resign oneself to any humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin of an aristocratic society that is to say of the preliminary condition for the elevation of the type man the truth is hard let us acknowledge unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has originated men with a still natural nature barbarians in every terrible sense of the word men of prey still in possession of unbroken strength of will and desire for power threw themselves upon weaker more moral more peaceful races perhaps trading or cattle rearing communities or upon old mellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickering out in brilliant fireworks of wit and depravity at the commencement the noble caste was always the barbarian caste their superiority did not consist first of all in their physical but in their psychical power they were more complete men which at every point also implies the same as more complete beasts corruption as the indication that anarchy threatens to break out among the instincts and that the foundation of the emotions called life is convulsed is something radically different according to the organization in which it manifests itself when for instance an aristocracy like that of france at the beginning of the revolution flung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself to an excess of its moral sentiments it was corruption it was really only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for centuries by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its lordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a function of royalty in the end even to its decoration and parade dress the essential thing however in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard itself as a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth but as the significance and highest justification thereof that it should therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion of individuals who for its sake must be suppressed and reduced to imperfect men to slaves and instruments its fundamental belief must be precisely that society is not allowed to exist for its own sake but only as a foundation and scaffolding by means of which a select class of beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties and in general to a higher existence like those sun seeking climbing plants in java they are called sipo matador which encircle an oak so long and so often with their arms until at last high above it but supported by it they can unfold their tops in the open light and exhibit their happiness to refrain mutually from injury from violence from exploitation and put one s will on a par with that of others this may result in a certain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessary conditions are given namely the actual similarity of the individuals in amount of force and degree of worth and their co relation within one organization as soon however as one wished to take this principle more generally and if possible even as the fundamental principle of society it would immediately disclose what it really is namely a will to the denial of life a principle of dissolution and decay here one must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental weakness life itself is essentially appropriation injury conquest of the strange and weak suppression severity obtrusion of peculiar forms incorporation and at the least putting it mildest exploitation but why should one for ever use precisely these words on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped even the organization within which as was previously supposed the individuals treat each other as equal it takes place in every healthy aristocracy must itself if it be a living and not a dying organization do all that towards other bodies which the individuals within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the incarnated will to power it will endeavour to grow to gain ground attract to itself and acquire ascendancy not owing to any morality or immorality but because it lives and because life is precisely will to power on no point however is the ordinary consciousness of europeans more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter people now rave everywhere even under the guise of science about coming conditions of society in which the exploiting character is to be absent that sounds to my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which should refrain from all organic functions exploitation does not belong to a depraved or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of the living being as a primary organic function it is a consequence of the intrinsic will to power which is precisely the will to life granting that as a theory this is a novelty as a reality it is the fundamental fact of all history let us be so far honest towards ourselves in a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth i found certain traits recurring regularly together and connected with one another until finally two primary types revealed themselves to me and a radical distinction was brought to light there is master morality and slave morality i would at once add however that in all higher and mixed civilizations there are also attempts at the reconciliation of the two moralities but one finds still oftener the confusion and mutual misunderstanding of them indeed sometimes their close juxtaposition even in the same man within one soul the distinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled or among the ruled class the slaves and dependents of all sorts in the first case when it is the rulers who determine the conception good it is the exalted proud disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature and that which determines the order of rank the noble type of man separates from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted proud disposition displays itself he despises them let it at once be noted that in this first kind of morality the antithesis good and bad means practically the same as noble and despicable the antithesis good and evil is of a different origin the cowardly the timid the insignificant and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised moreover also the distrustful with their constrained glances the self abasing the dog like kind of men who let themselves be abused the mendicant flatterers and above all the liars it is a fundamental belief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful we truthful ones the nobility in ancient greece called themselves it is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to men and were only derivatively and at a later period applied to actions it is a gross mistake therefore when historians of morals start with questions like why have sympathetic actions been praised the noble type of man regards himself as a determiner of values he does not require to be approved of he passes the judgment what is injurious to me is injurious in itself he knows that it is he himself only who confers honour on things he is a creator of values he honours whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equals self glorification in the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude of power which seeks to overflow the happiness of high tension the consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow the noble man also helps the unfortunate but not or scarcely out of pity but rather from an impulse generated by the super abundance of power the noble man honours in himself the powerful one him also who has power over himself who knows how to speak and how to keep silence who takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness and has reverence for all that is severe and hard wotan placed a hard heart in my breast says an old scandinavian saga it is thus rightly expressed from the soul of a proud viking such a type of man is even proud of not being made for sympathy the hero of the saga therefore adds warningly he who has not a hard heart when young will never have one the noble and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality which sees precisely in sympathy or in acting for the good of others or in desinteressement the characteristic of the moral faith in oneself pride in oneself a radical enmity and irony towards selflessness belong as definitely to noble morality as do a careless scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the warm heart it is the powerful who know how to honour it is their art their domain for invention the profound reverence for age and for tradition all law rests on this double reverence the belief and prejudice in favour of ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers is typical in the morality of the powerful and if reversely men of modern ideas believe almost instinctively in progress and the future and are more and more lacking in respect for old age the ignoble origin of these ideas has complacently betrayed itself thereby a morality of the ruling class however is more especially foreign and irritating to present day taste in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to one s equals that one may act towards beings of a lower rank towards all that is foreign just as seems good to one or as the heart desires and in any case beyond good and evil it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have a place the ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge both only within the circle of equals artfulness in retaliation raffinement of the idea in friendship a certain necessity to have enemies as outlets for the emotions of envy quarrelsomeness arrogance in fact in order to be a good friend all these are typical characteristics of the noble morality which as has been pointed out is not the morality of modern ideas and is therefore at present difficult to realize and also to unearth and disclose it is otherwise with the second type of morality slave morality supposing that the abused the oppressed the suffering the unemancipated the weary and those uncertain of themselves should moralize what will be the common element in their moral estimates probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with his situation the slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the powerful he has a skepticism and distrust a refinement of distrust of everything good that is there honoured he would fain persuade himself that the very happiness there is not genuine on the other hand those qualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into prominence and flooded with light it is here that sympathy the kind helping hand the warm heart patience diligence humility and friendliness attain to honour for here these are the most useful qualities and almost the only means of supporting the burden of existence slave morality is essentially the morality of utility here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evil power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of being despised according to slave morality therefore the evil man arouses fear according to master morality it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being the contrast attains its maximum when in accordance with the logical consequences of slave morality a shade of depreciation it may be slight and well intentioned at last attaches itself to the good man of this morality because according to the servile mode of thought the good man must in any case be the safe man he is good natured easily deceived perhaps a little stupid un bonhomme everywhere that slave morality gains the ascendancy language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words good and stupid a last fundamental difference the desire for freedom the instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty belong as necessarily to slave morals and morality as artifice and enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating hence we can understand without further detail why love as a passion it is our european specialty must absolutely be of noble origin as is well known its invention is due to the provencal poet cavaliers those brilliant ingenious men of the gai saber to whom europe owes so much and almost owes itself vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for a noble man to understand he will be tempted to deny it where another kind of man thinks he sees it self evidently the problem for him is to represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of themselves which they themselves do not possess and consequently also do not deserve and who yet believe in this good opinion afterwards this seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so self disrespectful and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable that he would like to consider vanity an exception and is doubtful about it in most cases when it is spoken of he will say for instance i may be mistaken about my value and on the other hand may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely as i rate it that however is not vanity but self conceit or in most cases that which is called humility and also modesty or he will even say for many reasons i can delight in the good opinion of others perhaps because i love and honour them and rejoice in all their joys perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps because the good opinion of others even in cases where i do not share it is useful to me or gives promise of usefulness all this however is not vanity the man of noble character must first bring it home forcibly to his mind especially with the aid of history that from time immemorial in all social strata in any way dependent the ordinary man was only that which he passed for not being at all accustomed to fix values he did not assign even to himself any other value than that which his master assigned to him it is the peculiar right of masters to create values it may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinary atavism that the ordinary man even at present is still always waiting for an opinion about himself and then instinctively submitting himself to it yet by no means only to a good opinion but also to a bad and unjust one think for instance of the greater part of the self appreciations and self depreciations which believing women learn from their confessors and which in general the believing christian learns from his church in fact conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and its cause the blending of the blood of masters and slaves the originally noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves and to think well of themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but it has at all times an older ampler and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to it and in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity overmasters the younger the vain person rejoices over every good opinion which he hears about himself quite apart from the point of view of its usefulness and equally regardless of its truth or falsehood just as he suffers from every bad opinion for he subjects himself to both he feels himself subjected to both by that oldest instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him it is the slave in the vain man s blood the remains of the slave s craftiness and how much of the slave is still left in woman for instance which seeks to seduce to good opinions of itself it is the slave too who immediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions as though he had not called them forth and to repeat it again vanity is an atavism a species originates and a type becomes established and strong in the long struggle with essentially constant unfavourable conditions on the other hand it is known by the experience of breeders that species which receive super abundant nourishment and in general a surplus of protection and care immediately tend in the most marked way to develop variations and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities also in monstrous vices now look at an aristocratic commonwealth say an ancient greek polis or venice as a voluntary or involuntary contrivance for the purpose of rearing human beings there are there men beside one another thrown upon their own resources who want to make their species prevail chiefly because they must prevail or else run the terrible danger of being exterminated the favour the super abundance the protection are there lacking under which variations are fostered the species needs itself as species as something which precisely by virtue of its hardness its uniformity and simplicity of structure can in general prevail and make itself permanent in constant struggle with its neighbours or with rebellious or rebellion threatening vassals the most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists in spite of all gods and men and has hitherto been victorious these qualities it calls virtues and these virtues alone it develops to maturity it does so with severity indeed it desires severity every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education of youth in the control of women in the marriage customs in the relations of old and young in the penal laws which have an eye only for the degenerating it counts intolerance itself among the virtues under the name of justice a type with few but very marked features a species of severe warlike wisely silent reserved and reticent men and as such with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and nuances of society is thus established unaffected by the vicissitudes of generations the constant struggle with uniform unfavourable conditions is as already remarked the cause of a type becoming stable and hard finally however a happy state of things results the enormous tension is relaxed there are perhaps no more enemies among the neighbouring peoples and the means of life even of the enjoyment of life are present in superabundance with one stroke the bond and constraint of the old discipline severs it is no longer regarded as necessary as a condition of existence if it would continue it can only do so as a form of luxury as an archaizing taste variations whether they be deviations into the higher finer and rarer or deteriorations and monstrosities appear suddenly on the scene in the greatest exuberance and splendour the individual dares to be individual and detach himself at this turning point of history there manifest themselves side by side and often mixed and entangled together a magnificent manifold virgin forest like up growth and up striving a kind of tropical tempo in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinary decay and self destruction owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoisms which strive with one another for sun and light and can no longer assign any limit restraint or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality it was this morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously which bent the bow in so threatening a manner it is now out of date it is getting out of date the dangerous and disquieting point has been reached when the greater more manifold more comprehensive life is lived beyond the old morality the individual stands out and is obliged to have recourse to his own law giving his own arts and artifices for self preservation self elevation and self deliverance nothing but new whys nothing but new hows no common formulas any longer misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other decay deterioration and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled the genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bad a portentous simultaneousness of spring and autumn full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh still inexhausted still unwearied corruption danger is again present the mother of morality great danger this time shifted into the individual into the neighbour and friend into the street into their own child into their own heart into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and volitions what will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach they discover these sharp onlookers and loafers that the end is quickly approaching that everything around them decays and produces decay that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow except one species of man the incurably mediocre the mediocre alone have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselves they will be the men of the future the sole survivors be like them become mediocre is now the only morality which has still a significance which still obtains a hearing but it is difficult to preach this morality of mediocrity it can never avow what it is and what it desires it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly love it will have difficulty in concealing its irony there is an instinct for rank which more than anything else is already the sign of a high rank there is a delight in the nuances of reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and habits the refinement goodness and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test when something passes by that is of the highest rank but is not yet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touches and incivilities something that goes its way like a living touchstone undistinguished undiscovered and tentative perhaps voluntarily veiled and disguised he whose task and practice it is to investigate souls will avail himself of many varieties of this very art to determine the ultimate value of a soul the unalterable innate order of rank to which it belongs he will test it by its instinct for reverence difference engendre haine the vulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly like dirty water when any holy vessel any jewel from closed shrines any book bearing the marks of great destiny is brought before it while on the other hand there is an involuntary silence a hesitation of the eye a cessation of all gestures by which it is indicated that a soul feels the nearness of what is worthiest of respect the way in which on the whole the reverence for the bible has hitherto been maintained in europe is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of manners which europe owes to christianity books of such profoundness and supreme significance require for their protection an external tyranny of authority in order to acquire the period of thousands of years which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them much has been achieved when the sentiment has been at last instilled into the masses the shallow pates and the boobies of every kind that they are not allowed to touch everything that there are holy experiences before which they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand it is almost their highest advance towards humanity on the contrary in the so called cultured classes the believers in modern ideas nothing is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame the easy insolence of eye and hand with which they touch taste and finger everything and it is possible that even yet there is more relative nobility of taste and more tact for reverence among the people among the lower classes of the people especially among peasants than among the newspaper reading demimonde of intellect the cultured class it cannot be effaced from a man s soul what his ancestors have preferably and most constantly done whether they were perhaps diligent economizers attached to a desk and a cash box modest and citizen like in their desires modest also in their virtues or whether they were accustomed to commanding from morning till night fond of rude pleasures and probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities or whether finally at one time or another they have sacrificed old privileges of birth and possession in order to live wholly for their faith for their god as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience which blushes at every compromise it is quite impossible for a man not to have the qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in his constitution whatever appearances may suggest to the contrary this is the problem of race granted that one knows something of the parents it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child any kind of offensive incontinence any kind of sordid envy or of clumsy self vaunting the three things which together have constituted the genuine plebeian type in all times such must pass over to the child as surely as bad blood and with the help of the best education and culture one will only succeed in deceiving with regard to such heredity and what else does education and culture try to do nowadays in our very democratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture must be essentially the art of deceiving deceiving with regard to origin with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul an educator who nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else and called out constantly to his pupils be true be natural show yourselves as you are even such a virtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short time to have recourse to the furca of horace naturam expellere with what results plebeianism usque recurret footnote horace s epistles i x at the risk of displeasing innocent ears i submit that egoism belongs to the essence of a noble soul i mean the unalterable belief that to a being such as we other beings must naturally be in subjection and have to sacrifice themselves the noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question and also without consciousness of harshness constraint or arbitrariness therein but rather as something that may have its basis in the primary law of things if he sought a designation for it he would say it is justice itself he acknowledges under certain circumstances which made him hesitate at first that there are other equally privileged ones as soon as he has settled this question of rank he moves among those equals and equally privileged ones with the same assurance as regards modesty and delicate respect which he enjoys in intercourse with himself in accordance with an innate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand it is an additional instance of his egoism this artfulness and self limitation in intercourse with his equals every star is a similar egoist he honours himself in them and in the rights which he concedes to them he has no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights as the essence of all intercourse belongs also to the natural condition of things the noble soul gives as he takes prompted by the passionate and sensitive instinct of requital which is at the root of his nature the notion of favour has inter pares neither significance nor good repute there may be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one from above and of drinking them thirstily like dew drops but for those arts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude his egoism hinders him here in general he looks aloft unwillingly he looks either forward horizontally and deliberately or downwards he knows that he is on a height one can only truly esteem him who does not look out for himself goethe to rath schlosser the chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach their children siao sin make thy heart small this is the essentially fundamental tendency in latter day civilizations i have no doubt that an ancient greek also would first of all remark the self dwarfing in us europeans of today in this respect alone we should immediately be distasteful to him what after all is ignobleness words are vocal symbols for ideas ideas however are more or less definite mental symbols for frequently returning and concurring sensations for groups of sensations it is not sufficient to use the same words in order to understand one another we must also employ the same words for the same kind of internal experiences we must in the end have experiences in common on this account the people of one nation understand one another better than those belonging to different nations even when they use the same language or rather when people have lived long together under similar conditions of climate soil danger requirement toil there originates therefrom an entity that understands itself namely a nation in all souls a like number of frequently recurring experiences have gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely about these matters people understand one another rapidly and always more rapidly the history of language is the history of a process of abbreviation on the basis of this quick comprehension people always unite closer and closer the greater the danger the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary not to misunderstand one another in danger that is what cannot at all be dispensed with in intercourse also in all loves and friendships one has the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery has been made that in using the same words one of the two parties has feelings thoughts intuitions wishes or fears different from those of the other the fear of the eternal misunderstanding that is the good genius which so often keeps persons of different sexes from too hasty attachments to which sense and heart prompt them and not some schopenhauerian genius of the species whichever groups of sensations within a soul awaken most readily begin to speak and give the word of command these decide as to the general order of rank of its values and determine ultimately its list of desirable things a man s estimates of value betray something of the structure of his soul and wherein it sees its conditions of life its intrinsic needs supposing now that necessity has from all time drawn together only such men as could express similar requirements and similar experiences by similar symbols it results on the whole that the easy communicability of need which implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and common experiences must have been the most potent of all the forces which have hitherto operated upon mankind the more similar the more ordinary people have always had and are still having the advantage the more select more refined more unique and difficultly comprehensible are liable to stand alone they succumb to accidents in their isolation and seldom propagate themselves one must appeal to immense opposing forces in order to thwart this natural all too natural progressus in simile the evolution of man to the similar the ordinary the average the gregarious to the ignoble the more a psychologist a born an unavoidable psychologist and soul diviner turns his attention to the more select cases and individuals the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy he needs sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man for the corruption the ruination of higher men of the more unusually constituted souls is in fact the rule it is dreadful to have such a rule always before one s eyes the manifold torment of the psychologist who has discovered this ruination who discovers once and then discovers almost repeatedly throughout all history this universal inner desperateness of higher men this eternal too late in every sense may perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his own lot and of his making an attempt at self destruction of his going to ruin himself one may perceive in almost every psychologist a tell tale inclination for delightful intercourse with commonplace and well ordered men the fact is thereby disclosed that he always requires healing that he needs a sort of flight and forgetfulness away from what his insight and incisiveness from what his business has laid upon his conscience the fear of his memory is peculiar to him he is easily silenced by the judgment of others he hears with unmoved countenance how people honour admire love and glorify where he has perceived or he even conceals his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion perhaps the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that precisely where he has learnt great sympathy together with great contempt the multitude the educated and the visionaries have on their part learnt great reverence reverence for great men and marvelous animals for the sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland the earth the dignity of mankind and one s own self to whom one points the young and in view of whom one educates them and who knows but in all great instances hitherto just the same happened that the multitude worshipped a god and that the god was only a poor sacrificial animal success has always been the greatest liar and the work itself is a success the great statesman the conqueror the discoverer are disguised in their creations until they are unrecognizable the work of the artist of the philosopher only invents him who has created it is reputed to have created it the great men as they are reverenced are poor little fictions composed afterwards in the world of historical values spurious coinage prevails those great poets for example such as byron musset poe leopardi kleist gogol i do not venture to mention much greater names but i have them in my mind as they now appear and were perhaps obliged to be men of the moment enthusiastic sensuous and childish light minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed often taking revenge with their works for an internal defilement often seeking forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory often lost in the mud and almost in love with it until they become like the will o the wisps around the swamps and pretend to be stars the people then call them idealists often struggling with protracted disgust with an ever reappearing phantom of disbelief which makes them cold and obliges them to languish for gloria and devour faith as it is out of the hands of intoxicated adulators what a torment these great artists are and the so called higher men in general to him who has once found them out it is thus conceivable that it is just from woman who is clairvoyant in the world of suffering and also unfortunately eager to help and save to an extent far beyond her powers that they have learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted sympathy which the multitude above all the reverent multitude do not understand and overwhelm with prying and self gratifying interpretations this sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power woman would like to believe that love can do everything it is the superstition peculiar to her alas he who knows the heart finds out how poor helpless pretentious and blundering even the best and deepest love is he finds that it rather destroys than saves it is possible that under the holy fable and travesty of the life of jesus there is hidden one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of knowledge about love the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart that never had enough of any human love that demanded love that demanded inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else with terrible outbursts against those who refused him their love the story of a poor soul insatiated and insatiable in love that had to invent hell to send thither those who would not love him and that at last enlightened about human love had to invent a god who is entire love entire capacity for love who takes pity on human love because it is so paltry so ignorant he who has such sentiments he who has such knowledge about love seeks for death but why should one deal with such painful matters provided of course that one is not obliged to do so the intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who has suffered deeply it almost determines the order of rank how deeply men can suffer the chilling certainty with which he is thoroughly imbued and coloured that by virtue of his suffering he knows more than the shrewdest and wisest can ever know that he has been familiar with and at home in many distant dreadful worlds of which you know nothing this silent intellectual haughtiness of the sufferer this pride of the elect of knowledge of the initiated of the almost sacrificed finds all forms of disguise necessary to protect itself from contact with officious and sympathizing hands and in general from all that is not its equal in suffering profound suffering makes noble it separates one of the most refined forms of disguise is epicurism along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which takes suffering lightly and puts itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound they are gay men who make use of gaiety because they are misunderstood on account of it they wish to be misunderstood there are scientific minds who make use of science because it gives a gay appearance and because scientificness leads to the conclusion that a person is superficial they wish to mislead to a false conclusion there are free insolent minds which would fain conceal and deny that they are broken proud incurable hearts the cynicism of hamlet the case of galiani and occasionally folly itself is the mask of an unfortunate over assured knowledge from which it follows that it is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence for the mask and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place that which separates two men most profoundly is a different sense and grade of purity what does it matter about all their honesty and reciprocal usefulness what does it matter about all their mutual good will the fact still remains they cannot smell each other the highest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in the most extraordinary and dangerous isolation as a saint for it is just holiness the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question any kind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath any kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out of night into the morning and out of gloom out of affliction into clearness brightness depth and refinement just as much as such a tendency distinguishes it is a noble tendency it also separates the pity of the saint is pity for the filth of the human all too human and there are grades and heights where pity itself is regarded by him as impurity as filth signs of nobility never to think of lowering our duties to the rank of duties for everybody to be unwilling to renounce or to share our responsibilities to count our prerogatives and the exercise of them among our duties a man who strives after great things looks upon every one whom he encounters on his way either as a means of advance or a delay and hindrance or as a temporary resting place his peculiar lofty bounty to his fellow men is only possible when he attains his elevation and dominates impatience and the consciousness of being always condemned to comedy up to that time for even strife is a comedy and conceals the end as every means does spoil all intercourse for him this kind of man is acquainted with solitude and what is most poisonous in it the problem of those who wait happy chances are necessary and many incalculable elements in order that a higher man in whom the solution of a problem is dormant may yet take action or break forth as one might say at the right moment on an average it does not happen and in all corners of the earth there are waiting ones sitting who hardly know to what extent they are waiting and still less that they wait in vain occasionally too the waking call comes too late the chance which gives permission to take action when their best youth and strength for action have been used up in sitting still and how many a one just as he sprang up has found with horror that his limbs are benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy it is too late he has said to himself and has become self distrustful and henceforth for ever useless in the domain of genius may not the raphael without hands taking the expression in its widest sense perhaps not be the exception but the rule perhaps genius is by no means so rare but rather the five hundred hands which it requires in order to tyrannize over the greek inserted here the right time in order to take chance by the forelock he who does not wish to see the height of a man looks all the more sharply at what is low in him and in the foreground and thereby betrays himself in all kinds of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul is better off than the nobler soul the dangers of the latter must be greater the probability that it will come to grief and perish is in fact immense considering the multiplicity of the conditions of its existence in a lizard a finger grows again which has been lost not so in man it is too bad always the old story when a man has finished building his house he finds that he has learnt unawares something which he ought absolutely to have known before he began to build the eternal fatal too late the melancholia of everything completed wanderer who art thou i see thee follow thy path without scorn without love with unfathomable eyes wet and sad as a plummet which has returned to the light insatiated out of every depth what did it seek down there with a bosom that never sighs with lips that conceal their loathing with a hand which only slowly grasps who art thou what hast thou done rest thee here this place has hospitality for every one refresh thyself and whoever thou art what is it that now pleases thee what will serve to refresh thee only name it whatever i have i offer thee to refresh me to refresh me oh thou prying one what sayest thou but give me i pray thee what what speak out another mask a second mask men of profound sadness betray themselves when they are happy they have a mode of seizing upon happiness as though they would choke and strangle it out of jealousy ah they know only too well that it will flee from them bad bad what does he not go back yes but you misunderstand him when you complain about it he goes back like every one who is about to make a great spring will people believe it of me but i insist that they believe it of me i have always thought very unsatisfactorily of myself and about myself only in very rare cases only compulsorily always without delight in the subject ready to digress from myself and always without faith in the result owing to an unconquerable distrust of the possibility of self knowledge which has led me so far as to feel a contradictio in adjecto even in the idea of direct knowledge which theorists allow themselves this matter of fact is almost the most certain thing i know about myself there must be a sort of repugnance in me to believe anything definite about myself is there perhaps some enigma therein probably but fortunately nothing for my own teeth perhaps it betrays the species to which i belong but not to myself as is sufficiently agreeable to me but what has happened to you i do not know he said hesitatingly perhaps the harpies have flown over my table it sometimes happens nowadays that a gentle sober retiring man becomes suddenly mad breaks the plates upsets the table shrieks raves and shocks everybody and finally withdraws ashamed and raging at himself whither for what purpose to famish apart to suffocate with his memories to him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul and only seldom finds his table laid and his food prepared the danger will always be great nowadays however it is extraordinarily so thrown into the midst of a noisy and plebeian age with which he does not like to eat out of the same dish he may readily perish of hunger and thirst or should he nevertheless finally fall to of sudden nausea we have probably all sat at tables to which we did not belong and precisely the most spiritual of us who are most difficult to nourish know the dangerous dyspepsia which originates from a sudden insight and disillusionment about our food and our messmates the after dinner nausea if one wishes to praise at all it is a delicate and at the same time a noble self control to praise only where one does not agree otherwise in fact one would praise oneself which is contrary to good taste a self control to be sure which offers excellent opportunity and provocation to constant misunderstanding to be able to allow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality one must not live among intellectual imbeciles but rather among men whose misunderstandings and mistakes amuse by their refinement or one will have to pay dearly for it he praises me therefore he acknowledges me to be right this asinine method of inference spoils half of the life of us recluses for it brings the asses into our neighbourhood and friendship to live in a vast and proud tranquility always beyond to have or not to have one s emotions one s for and against according to choice to lower oneself to them for hours to seat oneself on them as upon horses and often as upon asses for one must know how to make use of their stupidity as well as of their fire to conserve one s three hundred foregrounds also one s black spectacles for there are circumstances when nobody must look into our eyes still less into our motives and to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice politeness and to remain master of one s four virtues courage insight sympathy and solitude for solitude is a virtue with us as a sublime bent and bias to purity which divines that in the contact of man and man in society it must be unavoidably impure all society makes one somehow somewhere or sometime commonplace the greatest events and thoughts the greatest thoughts however are the greatest events are longest in being comprehended the generations which are contemporary with them do not experience such events they live past them something happens there as in the realm of stars the light of the furthest stars is longest in reaching man and before it has arrived man denies that there are stars there how many centuries does a mind require to be understood that is also a standard one also makes a gradation of rank and an etiquette therewith such as is necessary for mind and for star here is the prospect free the mind exalted footnote goethe s faust part ii act v the words of dr marianus but there is a reverse kind of man who is also upon a height and has also a free prospect but looks downwards what is noble what does the word noble still mean for us nowadays how does the noble man betray himself how is he recognized under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism by which everything is rendered opaque and leaden it is not his actions which establish his claim actions are always ambiguous always inscrutable neither is it his works one finds nowadays among artists and scholars plenty of those who betray by their works that a profound longing for nobleness impels them but this very need of nobleness is radically different from the needs of the noble soul itself and is in fact the eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof it is not the works but the belief which is here decisive and determines the order of rank to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper meaning it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself something which is not to be sought is not to be found and perhaps also is not to be lost the noble soul has reverence for itself there are men who are unavoidably intellectual let them turn and twist themselves as they will and hold their hands before their treacherous eyes as though the hand were not a betrayer it always comes out at last that they have something which they hide namely intellect one of the subtlest means of deceiving at least as long as possible and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider than one really is which in everyday life is often as desirable as an umbrella is called enthusiasm including what belongs to it for instance virtue for as galiani said who was obliged to know it vertu est enthousiasme in the writings of a recluse one always hears something of the echo of the wilderness something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilance of solitude in his strongest words even in his cry itself there sounds a new and more dangerous kind of silence of concealment he who has sat day and night from year s end to year s end alone with his soul in familiar discord and discourse he who has become a cave bear or a treasure seeker or a treasure guardian and dragon in his cave it may be a labyrinth but can also be a gold mine his ideas themselves eventually acquire a twilight colour of their own and an odour as much of the depth as of the mould something uncommunicative and repulsive which blows chilly upon every passer by the recluse does not believe that a philosopher supposing that a philosopher has always in the first place been a recluse ever expressed his actual and ultimate opinions in books are not books written precisely to hide what is in us indeed he will doubt whether a philosopher can have ultimate and actual opinions at all whether behind every cave in him there is not and must necessarily be a still deeper cave an ampler stranger richer world beyond the surface an abyss behind every bottom beneath every foundation every philosophy is a foreground philosophy this is a recluse s verdict there is something arbitrary in the fact that the philosopher came to a stand here took a retrospect and looked around that he here laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper there is also something suspicious in it every philosophy also conceals a philosophy every opinion is also a lurking place every word is also a mask every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being misunderstood the latter perhaps wounds his vanity but the former wounds his heart his sympathy which always says ah why would you also have as hard a time of it as i have man a complex mendacious artful and inscrutable animal uncanny to the other animals by his artifice and sagacity rather than by his strength has invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his soul as something simple and the whole of morality is a long audacious falsification by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of the soul becomes possible from this point of view there is perhaps much more in the conception of art than is generally believed a philosopher that is a man who constantly experiences sees hears suspects hopes and dreams extraordinary things who is struck by his own thoughts as if they came from the outside from above and below as a species of events and lightning flashes peculiar to him who is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightnings a portentous man around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and something uncanny going on a philosopher alas a being who often runs away from himself is often afraid of himself but whose curiosity always makes him come to himself again a man who says i like that i take it for my own and mean to guard and protect it from every one a man who can conduct a case carry out a resolution remain true to an opinion keep hold of a woman punish and overthrow insolence a man who has his indignation and his sword and to whom the weak the suffering the oppressed and even the animals willingly submit and naturally belong in short a man who is a master by nature when such a man has sympathy well that sympathy has value but of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer or of those even who preach sympathy there is nowadays throughout almost the whole of europe a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining an effeminizing which with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense seeks to deck itself out as something superior there is a regular cult of suffering the unmanliness of that which is called sympathy by such groups of visionaries is always i believe the first thing that strikes the eye one must resolutely and radically taboo this latest form of bad taste and finally i wish people to put the good amulet gai saber gay science in ordinary language on heart and neck as a protection against it the olympian vice despite the philosopher who as a genuine englishman tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking minds laughing is a bad infirmity of human nature which every thinking mind will strive to overcome hobbes i would even allow myself to rank philosophers according to the quality of their laughing up to those who are capable of golden laughter and supposing that gods also philosophize which i am strongly inclined to believe owing to many reasons i have no doubt that they also know how to laugh thereby in an overman like and new fashion and at the expense of all serious things gods are fond of ridicule it seems that they cannot refrain from laughter even in holy matters the genius of the heart as that great mysterious one possesses it the tempter god and born rat catcher of consciences whose voice can descend into the nether world of every soul who neither speaks a word nor casts a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch of allurement to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how to appear not as he is but in a guise which acts as an additional constraint on his followers to press ever closer to him to follow him more cordially and thoroughly the genius of the heart which imposes silence and attention on everything loud and self conceited which smoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new longing to lie placid as a mirror that the deep heavens may be reflected in them the genius of the heart which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate and to grasp more delicately which scents the hidden and forgotten treasure the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark ice and is a divining rod for every grain of gold long buried and imprisoned in mud and sand the genius of the heart from contact with which every one goes away richer not favoured or surprised not as though gratified and oppressed by the good things of others but richer in himself newer than before broken up blown upon and sounded by a thawing wind more uncertain perhaps more delicate more fragile more bruised but full of hopes which as yet lack names full of a new will and current full of a new ill will and counter current but what am i doing my friends of whom am i talking to you have i forgotten myself so far that i have not even told you his name unless it be that you have already divined of your own accord who this questionable god and spirit is that wishes to be praised in such a manner for as it happens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on his legs and in foreign lands i have also encountered on my path many strange and dangerous spirits above all however and again and again the one of whom i have just spoken in fact no less a personage than the god dionysus the great equivocator and tempter to whom as you know i once offered in all secrecy and reverence my first fruits the last as it seems to me who has offered a sacrifice to him for i have found no one who could understand what i was then doing in the meantime however i have learned much far too much about the philosophy of this god and as i said from mouth to mouth i the last disciple and initiate of the god dionysus and perhaps i might at last begin to give you my friends as far as i am allowed a little taste of this philosophy in a hushed voice as is but seemly for it has to do with much that is secret new strange wonderful and uncanny the very fact that dionysus is a philosopher and that therefore gods also philosophize seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring and might perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers among you my friends there is less to be said against it except that it comes too late and not at the right time for as it has been disclosed to me you are loth nowadays to believe in god and gods it may happen too that in the frankness of my story i must go further than is agreeable to the strict usages of your ears certainly the god in question went further very much further in such dialogues and was always many paces ahead of me indeed if it were allowed i should have to give him according to human usage fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit i should have to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer his fearless honesty truthfulness and love of wisdom but such a god does not know what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp keep that he would say for thyself and those like thee and whoever else require it i have no reason to cover my nakedness one suspects that this kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame he once said under certain circumstances i love mankind and referred thereby to ariadne who was present in my opinion man is an agreeable brave inventive animal that has not his equal upon earth he makes his way even through all labyrinths i like man and often think how i can still further advance him and make him stronger more evil and more profound stronger more evil and more profound i asked in horror yes he said again stronger more evil and more profound also more beautiful and thereby the tempter god smiled with his halcyon smile as though he had just paid some charming compliment one here sees at once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks and in general there are good grounds for supposing that in some things the gods could all of them come to us men for instruction we men are more human alas what are you after all my written and painted thoughts not long ago you were so variegated young and malicious so full of thorns and secret spices that you made me sneeze and laugh and now you have already doffed your novelty and some of you i fear are ready to become truths so immortal do they look so pathetically honest so tedious and was it ever otherwise what then do we write and paint we mandarins with chinese brush we immortalisers of things which lend themselves to writing what are we alone capable of painting alas only that which is just about to fade and begins to lose its odour alas only exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow sentiments alas only birds strayed and fatigued by flight which now let themselves be captured with the hand with our hand we immortalize what cannot live and fly much longer things only which are exhausted and mellow and it is only for your afternoon you my written and painted thoughts for which alone i have colours many colours perhaps many variegated softenings and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds but nobody will divine thereby how ye looked in your morning you sudden sparks and marvels of my solitude you my old beloved evil thoughts from the heights by f w nietzsche

for friends am ready day and night for my new friends come come the time is right this song is done the sweet sad cry of rue sang out its end a wizard wrought it he the timely friend the midday friend no do not ask me who at midday twas when one became as two we keep our feast of feasts sure of our bourne our aims self same the guest of guests friend zarathustra came the world now laughs the grisly veil was torn and light and dark were one that wedding morn preface it is often enough and always with great surprise intimated to me that there is something both ordinary and unusual in all my writings from the birth of tragedy to the recently published prelude to a philosophy of the future they all contain i have been told snares and nets for short sighted birds and something that is almost a constant subtle incitement to an overturning of habitual opinions and of approved customs what everything is merely human all too human with this exclamation my writings are gone through not without a certain dread and mistrust of ethic itself and not without a disposition to ask the exponent of evil things if those things be not simply misrepresented my writings have been termed a school of distrust still more of disdain also and more happily of courage audacity even and in fact i myself do not believe that anybody ever looked into the world with a distrust as deep as mine seeming as i do not simply the timely advocate of the devil but to employ theological terms an enemy and challenger of god and whosoever has experienced any of the consequences of such deep distrust anything of the chills and the agonies of isolation to which such an unqualified difference of standpoint condemns him endowed with it will also understand how often i must have sought relief and self forgetfulness from any source through any object of veneration or enmity of scientific seriousness or wanton lightness also why i when i could not find what i was in need of had to fashion it for myself counterfeiting it or imagining it and what poet or writer has ever done anything else and what other purpose can all the art in the world possibly have that which i always stood most in need of in order to effect my cure and self recovery was faith faith enough not to be thus isolated not to look at life from so singular a point of view a magic apprehension in eye and mind of relationship and equality a calm confidence in friendship a blindness free from suspicion and questioning to two sidedness a pleasure in externals superficialities the near the accessible in all things possessed of color skin and seeming perhaps i could be fairly reproached with much art in this regard many fine counterfeitings for example that wisely or wilfully i had shut my eyes to schopenhauer s blind will towards ethic at a time when i was already clear sighted enough on the subject of ethic likewise that i had deceived myself concerning richard wagner s incurable romanticism as if it were a beginning and not an end likewise concerning the greeks likewise concerning the germans and their future and there may be perhaps a long list of such likewises granted however that all this were true and with justice urged against me what does it signify what can it signify in regard to how much of the self sustaining capacity how much of reason and higher protection are embraced in such self deception and how much more falsity is still necessary to me that i may therewith always reassure myself regarding the luxury of my truth enough i still live and life is not considered now apart from ethic it will have deception it thrives lebt on deception but am i not beginning to do all over again what i have always done i the old immoralist and bird snarer talk unmorally ultramorally beyond good and evil thus then have i evolved for myself the free spirits to whom this discouraging encouraging work under the general title human all too human is dedicated such free spirits do not really exist and never did exist but i stood in need of them as i have pointed out in order that some good might be mixed with my evils illness loneliness strangeness acedia incapacity to serve as gay spirits and comrades with whom one may talk and laugh when one is disposed to talk and laugh and whom one may send to the devil when they grow wearisome they are some compensation for the lack of friends that such free spirits can possibly exist that our europe will yet number among her sons of to morrow or of the day after to morrow such a brilliant and enthusiastic company alive and palpable and not merely as in my case fantasms and imaginary shades i myself can by no means doubt i see them already coming slowly slowly may it not be that i am doing a little something to expedite their coming when i describe in advance the influences under which i see them evolving and the ways along which they travel it may be conjectured that a soul in which the type of free spirit can attain maturity and completeness had its decisive and deciding event in the form of a great emancipation or unbinding and that prior to that event it seemed only the more firmly and forever chained to its place and pillar what binds strongest what cords seem almost unbreakable in the case of mortals of a choice and lofty nature they will be those of duty that reverence which in youth is most typical that timidity and tenderness in the presence of the traditionally honored and the worthy that gratitude to the soil from which we sprung for the hand that guided us for the relic before which we were taught to pray their sublimest moments will themselves bind these souls most strongly the great liberation comes suddenly to such prisoners like an earthquake the young soul is all at once shaken torn apart cast forth it comprehends not itself what is taking place an involuntary onward impulse rules them with the mastery of command a will a wish are developed to go forward anywhere at any price a strong dangerous curiosity regarding an undiscovered world flames and flashes in all their being better to die than live here so sounds the tempting voice and this here this at home constitutes all they have hitherto loved a sudden dread and distrust of that which they loved a flash of contempt for that which is called their duty a mutinous wilful volcanic like longing for a far away journey strange scenes and people annihilation petrifaction a hatred surmounting love perhaps a sacrilegious impulse and look backwards to where they so long prayed and loved perhaps a flush of shame for what they did and at the same time an exultation at having done it an inner intoxicating delightful tremor in which is betrayed the sense of victory a victory over what over whom a riddle like victory fruitful in questioning and well worth questioning but the first victory for all such things of pain and ill belong to the history of the great liberation and it is at the same time a malady that can destroy a man this first outbreak of strength and will for self destination self valuation this will for free will and how much illness is forced to the surface in the frantic strivings and singularities with which the freedman the liberated seeks henceforth to attest his mastery over things he roves fiercely around with an unsatisfied longing and whatever objects he may encounter must suffer from the perilous expectancy of his pride he tears to pieces whatever attracts him with a sardonic laugh he overturns whatever he finds veiled or protected by any reverential awe he would see what these things look like when they are overturned it is wilfulness and delight in the wilfulness of it if he now perhaps gives his approval to that which has heretofore been in ill repute if in curiosity and experiment he penetrates stealthily to the most forbidden things in the background during all his plunging and roaming for he is as restless and aimless in his course as if lost in a wilderness is the interrogation mark of a curiosity growing ever more dangerous can we not upset every standard and is good perhaps evil and god only an invention and a subtlety of the devil is everything in the last resort false and if we are dupes are we not on that very account dupers also must we not be dupers also such reflections lead and mislead him ever further on ever further away solitude that dread goddess and mater saeva cupidinum encircles and besets him ever more threatening more violent more heart breaking but who to day knows what solitude is from this morbid solitude from the deserts of such trial years the way is yet far to that great overflowing certainty and healthiness which cannot dispense even with sickness as a means and a grappling hook of knowledge to that matured freedom of the spirit which is in an equal degree self mastery and discipline of the heart and gives access to the path of much and various reflection to that inner comprehensiveness and self satisfaction of over richness which precludes all danger that the spirit has gone astray even in its own path and is sitting intoxicated in some corner or other to that overplus of plastic healing imitative and restorative power which is the very sign of vigorous health that overplus which confers upon the free spirit the perilous prerogative of spending a life in experiment and of running adventurous risks the past master privilege of the free spirit in the interval there may be long years of convalescence years filled with many hued painfully bewitching transformations dominated and led to the goal by a tenacious will for health that is often emboldened to assume the guise and the disguise of health there is a middle ground to this which a man of such destiny can not subsequently recall without emotion he basks in a special fine sun of his own with a feeling of birdlike freedom birdlike visual power birdlike irrepressibleness a something extraneous drittes in which curiosity and delicate disdain have united a free spirit this refreshing term is grateful in any mood it almost sets one aglow one lives no longer in the bonds of love and hate without a yes or no here or there indifferently best pleased to evade to avoid to beat about neither advancing nor retreating one is habituated to the bad like a person who all at once sees a fearful hurly burly beneath him and one was the counterpart of him who bothers himself with things that do not concern him as a matter of fact the free spirit is bothered with mere things and how many things which no longer concern him a step further in recovery and the free spirit draws near to life again slowly indeed almost refractorily almost distrustfully there is again warmth and mellowness feeling and fellow feeling acquire depth lambent airs stir all about him he almost feels it seems as if now for the first time his eyes are open to things near he is in amaze and sits hushed for where had he been these near and immediate things how changed they seem to him he looks gratefully back grateful for his wandering his self exile and severity his lookings afar and his bird flights in the cold heights how fortunate that he has not like a sensitive dull home body remained always in the house and at home he had been beside himself beyond a doubt now for the first time he really sees himself and what surprises in the process what hitherto unfelt tremors yet what joy in the exhaustion the old sickness the relapses of the convalescent how it delights him suffering to sit still to exercise patience to lie in the sun who so well as he appreciates the fact that there comes balmy weather even in winter who delights more in the sunshine athwart the wall they are the most appreciative creatures in the world and also the most humble these convalescents and lizards crawling back towards life there are some among them who can let no day slip past them without addressing some song of praise to its retreating light and speaking seriously it is a fundamental cure for all pessimism the cankerous vice as is well known of all idealists and humbugs to become ill in the manner of these free spirits to remain ill quite a while and then bit by bit grow healthy i mean healthier it is wisdom worldly wisdom to administer even health to oneself for a long time in small doses about this time it becomes at last possible amid the flash lights of a still unestablished still precarious health for the free the ever freer spirit to begin to read the riddle of that great liberation a riddle which has hitherto lingered obscure well worth questioning almost impalpable in his memory if once he hardly dared to ask why so apart so alone renouncing all i loved renouncing respect itself why this coldness this suspicion this hate for one s very virtues now he dares and asks it loudly already hearing the answer you had to become master over yourself master of your own good qualities formerly they were your masters but they should be merely your tools along with other tools you had to acquire power over your aye and no and learn to hold and withhold them in accordance with your higher aims you had to grasp the perspective of every representation werthsch tzung the dislocation distortion and the apparent end or teleology of the horizon besides whatever else appertains to the perspective also the element of demerit in its relation to opposing merit and the whole intellectual cost of every affirmative every negative you had to find out the inevitable error in every yes and in every no error as inseparable from life life itself as conditioned by the perspective and its inaccuracy above all you had to see with your own eyes where the error is always greatest there namely where life is littlest narrowest meanest least developed and yet cannot help looking upon itself as the goal and standard of things and smugly and ignobly and incessantly tearing to tatters all that is highest and greatest and richest and putting the shreds into the form of questions from the standpoint of its own well being you had to see with your own eyes the problem of classification rangordnung regulation concerning rank and station and how strength and sweep and reach of perspective wax upward together you had enough the free spirit knows henceforward which you had it has obeyed and also what it now can do and what it now for the first time dare ungerechtigkeit literally wrongfulness injustice unrighteousness accordingly the free spirit works out for itself an answer to that riddle of its liberation and concludes by generalizing upon its experience in the following fashion what i went through everyone must go through in whom any problem is germinated and strives to body itself forth the inner power and inevitability of this problem will assert themselves in due course as in the case of any unsuspected pregnancy long before the spirit has seen this problem in its true aspect and learned to call it by its right name our destiny exercises its influence over us even when as yet we have not learned its nature it is our future that lays down the law to our to day granted that it is the problem of classification of which we free spirits may say this is our problem yet it is only now in the midday of our life that we fully appreciate what preparations shifts trials ordeals stages were essential to that problem before it could emerge to our view and why we had to go through the various and contradictory longings and satisfactions of body and soul as circumnavigators and adventurers of that inner world called man as surveyors of that higher and of that progression that is also called man crowding in everywhere almost without fear disdaining nothing missing nothing testing everything sifting everything and eliminating the chance impurities until at last we could say we free spirits here a new problem here a long ladder on the rungs of which we ourselves have rested and risen which we have actually been at times here is a something higher a something deeper a something below us a vastly extensive order ordnung a comparative classification rangordnung that we perceive here our problem rangordnung the meaning is the problem of grasping the relative importance of things uebereinander one over another to what stage in the development just outlined the present book belongs or is assigned is something that will be hidden from no augur or psychologist for an instant but where are there psychologists to day in france certainly in russia perhaps certainly not in germany grounds are not wanting to be sure upon which the germans of to day may adduce this fact to their credit unhappily for one who in this matter is fashioned and mentored in an un german school this german book which has found its readers in a wide circle of lands and peoples it has been some ten years on its rounds and which must make its way by means of any musical art and tune that will captivate the foreign ear as well as the native this book has been read most indifferently in germany itself and little heeded there to what is that due it requires too much i have been told it addresses itself to men free from the press of petty obligations it demands fine and trained perceptions it requires a surplus a surplus of time of the lightness of heaven and of the heart of otium in the most unrestricted sense mere good things that we germans of to day have not got and therefore cannot give after so graceful a retort my philosophy bids me be silent and ask no more questions at times as the proverb says one remains a philosopher only because one says nothing nice spring of the first and last things chemistry of the notions and the feelings philosophical problems in almost all their aspects present themselves in the same interrogative formula now that they did two thousand years ago how can a thing develop out of its antithesis for example the reasonable from the non reasonable the animate from the inanimate the logical from the illogical altruism from egoism disinterestedness from greed truth from error the metaphysical philosophy formerly steered itself clear of this difficulty to such extent as to repudiate the evolution of one thing from another and to assign a miraculous origin to what it deemed highest and best due to the very nature and being of the thing in itself the historical philosophy on the other hand which can no longer be viewed apart from physical science the youngest of all philosophical methods discovered experimentally and its results will probably always be the same that there is no antithesis whatever except in the usual exaggerations of popular or metaphysical comprehension and that an error of the reason is at the bottom of such contradiction according to its explanation there is strictly speaking neither unselfish conduct nor a wholly disinterested point of view both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seems almost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenest observation all that we need and that could possibly be given us in the present state of development of the sciences is a chemistry of the moral religious aesthetic conceptions and feeling as well as of those emotions which we experience in the affairs great and small of society and civilization and which we are sensible of even in solitude but what if this chemistry established the fact that even in its domain the most magnificent results were attained with the basest and most despised ingredients would many feel disposed to continue such investigations mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin and beginning must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow the opposite course the traditional error of philosophers all philosophers make the common mistake of taking contemporary man as their starting point and of trying through an analysis of him to reach a conclusion man involuntarily presents himself to them as an aeterna veritas as a passive element in every hurly burly as a fixed standard of things yet everything uttered by the philosopher on the subject of man is in the last resort nothing more than a piece of testimony concerning man during a very limited period of time lack of the historical sense is the traditional defect in all philosophers many innocently take man in his most childish state as fashioned through the influence of certain religious and even of certain political developments as the permanent form under which man must be viewed they will not learn that man has evolved that the intellectual faculty itself is an evolution whereas some philosophers make the whole cosmos out of this intellectual faculty but everything essential in human evolution took place aeons ago long before the four thousand years or so of which we know anything during these man may not have changed very much however the philosopher ascribes instinct to contemporary man and assumes that this is one of the unalterable facts regarding man himself and hence affords a clue to the understanding of the universe in general the whole teleology is so planned that man during the last four thousand years shall be spoken of as a being existing from all eternity and with reference to whom everything in the cosmos from its very inception is naturally ordered yet everything evolved there are no eternal facts as there are no absolute truths accordingly historical philosophising is henceforth indispensable and with it honesty of judgment geworden appreciation of simple truths it is the characteristic of an advanced civilization to set a higher value upon little simple truths ascertained by scientific method than upon the pleasing and magnificent errors originating in metaphysical and sthetical epochs and peoples to begin with the former are spoken of with contempt as if there could be no question of comparison respecting them so rigid homely prosaic and even discouraging is the aspect of the first while so beautiful decorative intoxicating and perhaps beatific appear the last named nevertheless the hardwon the certain the lasting and therefore the fertile in new knowledge is the higher to hold fast to it is manly and evinces courage directness endurance and not only individual men but all mankind will by degrees be uplifted to this manliness when they are finally habituated to the proper appreciation of tenable enduring knowledge and have lost all faith in inspiration and in the miraculous revelation of truth the reverers of forms indeed with their standards of beauty and taste may have good reason to laugh when the appreciation of little truths and the scientific spirit begin to prevail but that will be only because their eyes are not yet opened to the charm of the utmost simplicity of form or because men though reared in the rightly appreciative spirit will still not be fully permeated by it so that they continue unwittingly imitating ancient forms and that ill enough as anybody does who no longer feels any interest in a thing formerly the mind was not brought into play through the medium of exact thought its serious business lay in the working out of forms and symbols that has now changed any seriousness in symbolism is at present the indication of a deficient education as our very acts become more intellectual our tendencies more rational and our judgment for example as to what seems reasonable is very different from what it was a hundred years ago so the forms of our lives grow ever more intellectual and to the old fashioned eye perhaps uglier but only because it cannot see that the richness of inner rational beauty always spreads and deepens and that the inner rational aspect of all things should now be of more consequence to us than the most beautiful externality and the most exquisite limning astrology and the like it is presumable that the objects of the religious moral aesthetic and logical notions pertain simply to the superficialities of things although man flatters himself with the thought that here at least he is getting to the heart of the cosmos he deceives himself because these things have power to make him so happy and so wretched and so he evinces in this respect the same conceit that characterises astrology astrology presupposes that the heavenly bodies are regulated in their movements in harmony with the destiny of mortals the moral man presupposes that that which concerns himself most nearly must also be the heart and soul of things misconception of dreams in the dream mankind in epochs of crude primitive civilization thought they were introduced to a second substantial world here we have the source of all metaphysic without the dream men would never have been incited to an analysis of the world even the distinction between soul and body is wholly due to the primitive conception of the dream as also the hypothesis of the embodied soul whence the development of all superstition and also probably the belief in god the dead still live for they appear to the living in dreams so reasoned mankind at one time and through many thousands of years the scientific spirit prevails only partially not wholly the specialized minutest departments of science are dealt with purely objectively but the general universal sciences considered as a great basic unity posit the question truly a very living question to what purpose what is the use because of this reference to utility they are as a whole less impersonal than when looked at in their specialized aspects now in the case of philosophy as forming the apex of the scientific pyramid this question of the utility of knowledge is necessarily brought very conspicuously forward so that every philosophy has unconsciously the air of ascribing the highest utility to itself it is for this reason that all philosophies contain such a great amount of high flying metaphysic and such a shrinking from the seeming insignificance of the deliverances of physical science for the significance of knowledge in relation to life must be made to appear as great as possible this constitutes the antagonism between the specialties of science and philosophy the latter aims as art aims at imparting to life and conduct the utmost depth and significance in the former mere knowledge is sought and nothing else whatever else be incidentally obtained heretofore there has never been a philosophical system in which philosophy itself was not made the apologist of knowledge in the abstract on this point at least each is optimistic and insists that to knowledge the highest utility must be ascribed they are all under the tyranny of logic which is from its very nature optimism the discordant element in science philosophy severed itself from science when it put the question what is that knowledge of the world and of life through which mankind may be made happiest this happened when the socratic school arose with the standpoint of happiness the arteries of investigating science were compressed too tightly to permit of any circulation of the blood and are so compressed to day pneumatic explanation of nature metaphysic reads the message of nature as if it were written purely pneumatically as the church and its learned ones formerly did where the bible was concerned it requires a great deal of expertness to apply to nature the same strict science of interpretation that the philologists have devised for all literature and to apply it for the purpose of a simple direct interpretation of the message and at the same time not bring out a double meaning but as in the case of books and literature errors of exposition are far from being completely eliminated and vestiges of allegorical and mystical interpretations are still to be met with in the most cultivated circles so where nature is concerned the case is actually much worse pneumatic is here used in the sense of spiritual pneuma being the greek word in the new testament for the holy spirit ed metaphysical world it is true there may be a metaphysical world the absolute possibility of it can scarcely be disputed we see all things through the medium of the human head and we cannot well cut off this head although there remains the question what part of the world would be left after it had been cut off but that is a purely abstract scientific problem and one not much calculated to give men uneasiness yet everything that has heretofore made metaphysical assumptions valuable fearful or delightful to men all that gave rise to them is passion error and self deception the worst systems of knowledge not the best pin their tenets of belief thereto when such methods are once brought to view as the basis of all existing religions and metaphysics they are already discredited there always remains however the possibility already conceded but nothing at all can be made out of that to say not a word about letting happiness salvation and life hang upon the threads spun from such a possibility accordingly nothing could be predicated of the metaphysical world beyond the fact that it is an elsewhere another sphere inaccessible and incomprehensible to us it would become a thing of negative properties even were the existence of such a world absolutely established it would nevertheless remain incontrovertible that of all kinds of knowledge knowledge of such a world would be of least consequence of even less consequence than knowledge of the chemical analysis of water would be to a storm tossed mariner anderssein the harmlessness of metaphysic in the future as soon as religion art and ethics are so understood that a full comprehension of them can be gained without taking refuge in the postulates of metaphysical claptrap at any point in the line of reasoning there will be a complete cessation of interest in the purely theoretical problem of the thing in itself and the phenomenon for here too the same truth applies in religion art and ethics we are not concerned with the essence of the cosmos we are in the sphere of pure conception no presentiment or intuition can carry us any further with perfect tranquility the question of how our conception of the world could differ so sharply from the actual world as it is manifest to us will be relegated to the physiological sciences and to the history of the evolution of ideas and organisms wesen der welt an sich language as a presumptive science the importance of language in the development of civilization consists in the fact that by means of it man placed one world his own alongside another a place of leverage that he thought so firm as to admit of his turning the rest of the cosmos on a pivot that he might master it in so far as man for ages looked upon mere ideas and names of things as upon aeternae veritates he evinced the very pride with which he raised himself above the brute he really supposed that in language he possessed a knowledge of the cosmos the language builder was not so modest as to believe that he was only giving names to things on the contrary he thought he embodied the highest wisdom concerning things in mere words and in truth language is the first movement in all strivings for wisdom here too it is faith in ascertained truth from which the mightiest fountains of strength have flowed very tardily only now it dawns upon men that they have propagated a monstrous error in their belief in language fortunately it is too late now to arrest and turn back the evolutionary process of the reason which had its inception in this belief logic itself rests upon assumptions to which nothing in the world of reality corresponds for example the correspondence of certain things to one another and the identity of those things at different periods of time are assumptions pure and simple but the science of logic originated in the positive belief that they were not assumptions at all but established facts it is the same with the science of mathematics which certainly would never have come into existence if mankind had known from the beginning that in all nature there is no perfectly straight line no true circle no standard of measurement glaube an die gefundene wahrheit as distinguished from faith in what is taken on trust as truth dream and civilization the function of the brain which is most encroached upon in slumber is the memory not that it is wholly suspended but it is reduced to a state of imperfection as in primitive ages of mankind was probably the case with everyone whether waking or sleeping uncontrolled and entangled as it is it perpetually confuses things as a result of the most trifling similarities yet in the same mental confusion and lack of control the nations invented their mythologies while nowadays travelers habitually observe how prone the savage is to forgetfulness how his mind after the least exertion of memory begins to wander and lose itself until finally he utters falsehood and nonsense from sheer exhaustion yet in dreams we all resemble this savage inadequacy of distinction and error of comparison are the basis of the preposterous things we do and say in dreams so that when we clearly recall a dream we are startled that so much idiocy lurks within us the absolute distinctness of all dream images due to implicit faith in their substantial reality recalls the conditions in which earlier mankind were placed for whom hallucinations had extraordinary vividness entire communities and even entire nations laboring simultaneously under them therefore in sleep and in dream we make the pilgrimage of early mankind over again logic of the dream during sleep the nervous system through various inner provocatives is in constant agitation almost all the organs act independently and vigorously the blood circulates rapidly the posture of the sleeper compresses some portions of the body the coverlets influence the sensations in different ways the stomach carries on the digestive process and acts upon other organs thereby the intestines are in motion the position of the head induces unaccustomed action the feet shoeless no longer pressing the ground are the occasion of other sensations of novelty as is indeed the changed garb of the entire body all these things following the bustle and change of the day result through their novelty in a movement throughout the entire system that extends even to the brain functions thus there are a hundred circumstances to induce perplexity in the mind a questioning as to the cause of this excitation now the dream is a seeking and presenting of reasons for these excitations of feeling of the supposed reasons that is to say thus for example whoever has his feet bound with two threads will probably dream that a pair of serpents are coiled about his feet this is at first a hypothesis then a belief with an accompanying imaginative picture and the argument these snakes must be the causa of those sensations which i the sleeper now have so reasons the mind of the sleeper the conditions precedent as thus conjectured become owing to the excitation of the fancy present realities everyone knows from experience how a dreamer will transform one piercing sound for example that of a bell into another of quite a different nature say the report of cannon in his dream he becomes aware first of the effects which he explains by a subsequent hypothesis and becomes persuaded of the purely conjectural nature of the sound but how comes it that the mind of the dreamer goes so far astray when the same mind awake is habitually cautious careful and so conservative in its dealings with hypotheses why does the first plausible hypothesis of the cause of a sensation gain credit in the dreaming state for in a dream we look upon that dream as reality that is we accept our hypotheses as fully established i have no doubt that as men argue in their dreams to day mankind argued even in their waking moments for thousands of years the first causa that occurred to the mind with reference to anything that stood in need of explanation was accepted as the true explanation and served as such savages show the same tendency in operation as the reports of travelers agree in the dream this atavistic relic of humanity manifests its existence within us for it is the foundation upon which the higher rational faculty developed itself and still develops itself in every individual dreams carry us back to the earlier stages of human culture and afford us a means of understanding it more clearly dream thought comes so easily to us now because we are so thoroughly trained to it through the interminable stages of evolution during which this fanciful and facile form of theorising has prevailed to a certain extent the dream is a restorative for the brain which during the day is called upon to meet the many demands for trained thought made upon it by the conditions of a higher civilization we may if we please become sensible even in our waking moments of a condition that is as a door and vestibule to dreaming if we close our eyes the brain immediately conjures up a medley of impressions of light and color apparently a sort of imitation and echo of the impressions forced in upon the brain during its waking moments and now the mind in co operation with the imagination transforms this formless play of light and color into definite figures moving groups landscapes what really takes place is a sort of reasoning from effect back to cause as the brain inquires whence these impressions of light and color it posits as the inducing causes of such lights and colors those shapes and figures they serve the brain as the occasions of those lights and colors because the brain when the eyes are open and the senses awake is accustomed to perceiving the cause of every impression of light and color made upon it here again the imagination is continually interposing its images inasmuch as it participates in the production of the impressions made through the senses day by day and the dream fancy does exactly the same thing that is the presumed cause is determined from the effect and after the effect all this too with extraordinary rapidity so that in this matter as in a matter of jugglery or sleight of hand a confusion of the mind is produced and an after effect is made to appear a simultaneous action an inverted succession of events even from these considerations we can see how late strict logical thought the true notion of cause and effect must have been in developing since our intellectual and rational faculties to this very day revert to these primitive processes of deduction while practically half our lifetime is spent in the super inducing conditions even the poet the artist ascribes to his sentimental and emotional states causes which are not the true ones to that extent he is a reminder of early mankind and can aid us in its comprehension association all strong feelings are associated with a variety of allied sentiments and emotions they stir up the memory at the same time when we are under their influence we are reminded of similar states and we feel a renewal of them within us thus are formed habitual successions of feelings and notions which at last when they follow one another with lightning rapidity are no longer felt as complexities but as unities in this sense we hear of moral feelings of religious feelings as if they were absolute unities in reality they are streams with a hundred sources and tributaries here again the unity of the word speaks nothing for the unity of the thing miterklingen to sound simultaneously with no within and without in the world as democritus transferred the notions above and below to limitless space where they are destitute of meaning so the philosophers do generally with the idea within and without as regards the form and substance wesen und erscheinung of the world what they claim is that through the medium of profound feelings one can penetrate deep into the soul of things innre draw close to the heart of nature but these feelings are deep only in so far as with them are simultaneously aroused although almost imperceptibly certain complicated groups of thoughts gedankengruppen which we call deep a feeling is deep because we deem the thoughts accompanying it deep but deep thought can nevertheless be very widely sundered from truth as for instance every metaphysical thought take from deep feeling the element of thought blended with it and all that remains is strength of feeling which is no voucher for the validity of knowledge as intense faith is evidence only of its own intensity and not of the truth of that in which the faith is felt kein innen und aussen in der welt the above translation may seem too literal but some dispute has arisen concerning the precise idea the author means to convey phenomenon and thing in itself the philosophers are in the habit of placing themselves in front of life and experience that which they call the world of phenomena as if they were standing before a picture that is unrolled before them in its final completeness this panorama they think must be studied in every detail in order to reach some conclusion regarding the object represented by the picture from effect accordingly is deduced cause and from cause is deduced the unconditioned this process is generally looked upon as affording the all sufficient explanation of the world of phenomena on the other hand one must while putting the conception of the metaphysical distinctly forward as that of the unconditioned and consequently of the unconditioning absolutely deny any connection between the unconditioned of the metaphysical world and the world known to us so that throughout phenomena there is no manifestation of the thing in itself and getting from one to the other is out of the question thus is left quite ignored the circumstance that the picture that which we now call life and experience is a gradual evolution is indeed still in process of evolution and for that reason should not be regarded as an enduring whole from which any conclusion as to its author the all sufficient reason could be arrived at or even pronounced out of the question it is because we have for thousands of years looked into the world with moral aesthetic religious predispositions with blind prejudice passion or fear and surfeited ourselves with indulgence in the follies of illogical thought that the world has gradually become so wondrously motley frightful significant soulful it has taken on tints but we have been the colorists the human intellect upon the foundation of human needs of human passions has reared all these phenomena and injected its own erroneous fundamental conceptions into things late very late the human intellect checks itself and now the world of experience and the thing in itself seem to it so severed and so antithetical that it denies the possibility of one s hinging upon the other or else summons us to surrender our intellect our personal will to the secret and the awe inspiring in order that thereby we may attain certainty of certainty hereafter again there are those who have combined all the characteristic features of our world of phenomena that is the conception of the world which has been formed and inherited through a series of intellectual vagaries and instead of holding the intellect responsible for it all have pronounced the very nature of things accountable for the present very sinister aspect of the world and preached annihilation of existence through all these views and opinions the toilsome steady process of science which now for the first time begins to celebrate its greatest triumph in the genesis of thought will definitely work itself out the result being perhaps to the following effect that which we now call the world is the result of a crowd of errors and fancies which gradually developed in the general evolution of organic nature have grown together and been transmitted to us as the accumulated treasure of all the past as the treasure for whatever is worth anything in our humanity rests upon it from this world of conception it is in the power of science to release us only to a slight extent and this is all that could be wished inasmuch as it cannot eradicate the influence of hereditary habits of feeling but it can light up by degrees the stages of the development of that world of conception and lift us at least for a time above the whole spectacle perhaps we may then perceive that the thing in itself is a meet subject for homeric laughter that it seemed so much everything indeed and is really a void void that is to say of meaning metaphysical explanation man when he is young prizes metaphysical explanations because they make him see matters of the highest import in things he found disagreeable or contemptible and if he is not satisfied with himself this feeling of dissatisfaction is soothed when he sees the most hidden world problem or world pain in that which he finds so displeasing in himself to feel himself more unresponsible and at the same time to find things dinge more interesting that is to him the double benefit he owes to metaphysics later indeed he acquires distrust of the whole metaphysical method of explaining things he then perceives perhaps that those effects could have been attained just as well and more scientifically by another method that physical and historical explanations would at least have given that feeling of freedom from personal responsibility just as well while interest in life and its problems would be stimulated perhaps even more the fundamental problems of metaphysics if a history of the development of thought is ever written the following proposition advanced by a distinguished logician will be illuminated with a new light the universal primordial law of the apprehending subject consists in the inner necessity of cognizing every object by itself as in its essence a thing unto itself therefore as self existing and unchanging in short as a substance even this law which is here called primordial is an evolution it has yet to be shown how gradually this evolution takes place in lower organizations how the dim mole eyes of such organizations see at first nothing but a blank sameness how later when the various excitations of desire and aversion manifest themselves various substances are gradually distinguished but each with an attribute that is a special relationship to such an organization the first step towards the logical is judgment the essence of which according to the best logicians is belief at the foundation of all beliefs lie sensations of pleasure or pain in relation to the apprehending subject a third feeling as the result of two prior single separate feelings is judgment in its crudest form we organic beings are primordially interested by nothing whatever in any thing ding except its relation to ourselves with reference to pleasure and pain between the moments in which we are conscious of this relation the states of feeling lie the moments of rest of not feeling then the world and every thing ding have no interest for us we observe no change in them as at present a person absorbed in something does not notice anyone passing by to plants all things are as a rule at rest eternal every object like itself from the period of lower organisms has been handed down to man the belief that there are like things gleiche dinge only the trained experience attained through the most advanced science contradicts this postulate the primordial belief of all organisms is perhaps that all the rest of the world is one thing and motionless furthest away from this first step towards the logical is the notion of causation even to day we think that all our feelings and doings are at bottom acts of the free will when the sentient individual contemplates himself he deems every feeling every change a something isolated disconnected that is to say unqualified by any thing it comes suddenly to the surface independent of anything that went before or came after we are hungry but originally we do not know that the organism must be nourished on the contrary that feeling seems to manifest itself without reason or purpose it stands out by itself and seems quite independent therefore the belief in the freedom of the will is a primordial error of everything organic as old as the very earliest inward prompting of the logical faculty belief in unconditioned substances and in like things gleiche dinge is also a primordial and equally ancient error of everything organic inasmuch as all metaphysic has concerned itself particularly with substance and with freedom of the will it should be designated as the science that deals with the fundamental errors of mankind as if they were fundamental truths number the invention of the laws of number has as its basis the primordial and prior prevailing delusion that many like things exist although in point of fact there is no such thing is a duplicate or that at least there are things but there is no thing the assumption of plurality always presupposes that something exists which manifests itself repeatedly but just here is where the delusion prevails in this very matter we feign realities unities that have no existence our feelings notions of space and time are false for they lead when duly tested to logical contradictions in all scientific demonstrations we always unavoidably base our calculation upon some false standards of duration or measurement but as these standards are at least constant as for example our notions of time and space the results arrived at by science possess absolute accuracy and certainty in their relationship to one another one can keep on building upon them until is reached that final limit at which the erroneous fundamental conceptions the invariable breakdown come into conflict with the results established as for example in the case of the atomic theory here we always find ourselves obliged to give credence to a thing or material substratum that is set in motion although at the same time the whole scientific programme has had as its aim the resolving of everything material into motions themselves here again we distinguish with our feeling that which does the moving and that which is moved and we never get out of this circle because the belief in things has been from time immemorial rooted in our nature when kant says the intellect does not derive its laws from nature but dictates them to her he states the full truth as regards the idea of nature which we form nature world as notion that is as error but which is merely the synthesis of a host of errors of the intellect to a world not the outcome of our conception the laws of number are wholly inapplicable such laws are valid only in the world of mankind wir scheiden auch hier noch mit unserer empfindung bewegendes und bewegtes glaube an dinge some backward steps one very forward step in education is taken when man emerges from his superstitious and religious ideas and fears and for instance no longer believes in the dear little angels or in original sin and has stopped talking about the salvation of the soul when he has taken this step to freedom he has nevertheless through the utmost exertion of his mental power to overcome metaphysics then a backward movement is necessary he must appreciate the historical justification and to an equal extent the psychological considerations in such a movement he must understand that the greatest advances made by mankind have resulted from such a course and that without this very backward movement the highest achievements of man hitherto would have been impossible with regard to philosophical metaphysics i see ever more and more who have arrived at the negative goal that all positive metaphysic is a delusion but as yet very few who go a few steps backward one should look out over the last rungs of the ladder but not try to stand on them that is to say the most advanced as yet go only far enough to free themselves from metaphysic and look back at it with an air of superiority whereas here no less than in the hippodrome it is necessary to turn around in order to reach the end of the course presumable nature of the victory of doubt let us assume for a moment the validity of the skeptical standpoint granted that there is no metaphysical world and that all the metaphysical explanations of the only world we know are useless to us how would we then contemplate men and things menschen und dinge this can be thought out and it is worth while doing so even if the question whether anything metaphysical has ever been demonstrated by or through kant and schopenhauer be put altogether aside for it is to all appearances highly probable that men on this point will be in the mass skeptical the question thus becomes what sort of a notion will human society under the influence of such a state of mind form of itself perhaps the scientific demonstration of any metaphysical world is now so difficult that mankind will never be free from a distrust of it and when there is formed a feeling of distrust of metaphysics the results are in the mass the same as if metaphysics were refuted altogether and could no longer be believed in both cases the historical question with regard to an unmetaphysical disposition in mankind remains the same disbelief in the monumentum aere perennius a decided disadvantage attending the termination of metaphysical modes of thought is that the individual fixes his mind too attentively upon his own brief lifetime and feels no strong inducement to aid in the foundation of institutions capable of enduring for centuries he wishes himself to gather the fruit from the tree that he plants and consequently he no longer plants those trees which require centuries of constant cultivation and are destined to afford shade to generation after generation in the future for metaphysical views inspire the belief that in them is afforded the final sure foundation upon which henceforth the whole future of mankind may rest and be built up the individual promotes his own salvation when for example he builds a church or a monastery he is of opinion that he is doing something for the salvation of his immortal soul can science as well inspire such faith in the efficacy of her results in actual fact science requires doubt and distrust as her surest auxiliaries nevertheless the sum of the irresistible that is all the onslaughts of skepticism all the disintegrating effects of surviving truths can easily become so great as for instance in the case of hygienic science as to inspire the determination to build eternal works upon it at present the contrast between our excitated ephemeral existence and the tranquil repose of metaphysical epochs is too great because both are as yet in too close juxtaposition the individual man himself now goes through too many stages of inner and outer evolution for him to venture to make a plan even for his life time alone a perfectly modern man indeed who wants to build himself a house feels as if he were walling himself up alive in a mausoleum monument more enduring than brass horace odes iii xxx age of comparison the less men are bound by tradition the greater is the inner activity of motives the greater correspondingly the outer restlessness the promiscuous flow of humanity the polyphony of strivings who now feels any great impulse to establish himself and his posterity in a particular place for whom moreover does there exist at present any strong tie as all the methods of the arts were copied from one another so were all the methods and advancements of moral codes of manners of civilizations such an age derives its significance from the fact that in it the various ideas codes manners and civilizations can be compared and experienced side by side which was impossible at an earlier period in view of the localised nature of the rule of every civilization corresponding to the limitation of all artistic effects by time and place to day the growth of the aesthetic feeling is decided owing to the great number of artistic forms which offer themselves for comparison the majority those that are condemned by the method of comparison will be allowed to die out in the same way there is to day taking place a selection of the forms and customs of the higher morality which can result only in the extinction of the vulgar moralities this is the age of comparison that is its glory but also its pain let us not however shrink from this pain rather would we comprehend the nature of the task imposed upon us by our age as adequately as we can posterity will bless us for doing so a posterity that knows itself to be developed through and above the narrow early race civilizations as well as the culture civilization of comparison but yet looks gratefully back upon both as venerable monuments of antiquity possibility of progress when a master of the old civilization den alten cultur vows to hold no more discussion with men who believe in progress he is quite right for the old civilization has its greatness and its advantages behind it and historic training forces one to acknowledge that it can never again acquire vigor only intolerable stupidity or equally intolerable fanaticism could fail to perceive this fact but men may consciously determine to evolve to a new civilization where formerly they evolved unconsciously and accidentally they can now devise better conditions for the advancement of mankind for their nourishment training and education they can administer the earth as an economic power and particularly compare the capacities of men and select them accordingly this new conscious civilization is killing the other which on the whole has led but an unreflective animal and plant life it is also destroying the doubt of progress itself progress is possible i mean it is hasty and almost unreflective to assume that progress must necessarily take place but how can it be doubted that progress is possible on the other hand progress in the sense and along the lines of the old civilization is not even conceivable if romantic fantasy employs the word progress in connection with certain aims and ends identical with those of the circumscribed primitive national civilizations the picture presented of progress is always borrowed from the past the idea and the image of progress thus formed are quite without originality cultur culture civilisation etc but there is no exact english equivalent private ethics and world ethics since the extinction of the belief that a god guides the general destiny of the world and notwithstanding all the contortions and windings of the path of mankind leads it gloriously forward men must shape oecumenical world embracing ends for themselves the older ethics namely kant s required of the individual such a course of conduct as he wishes all men to follow this evinces much simplicity as if any individual could determine off hand what course of conduct would conduce to the welfare of humanity and what course of conduct is pre minently desirable this is a theory like that of freedom of competition which takes it for granted that the general harmony of things must prevail of itself in accordance with some inherent law of betterment or amelioration it may be that a later contemplation of the needs of mankind will reveal that it is by no means desirable that all men should regulate their conduct according to the same principle it may be best from the standpoint of certain ends yet to be attained that men during long periods should regulate their conduct with reference to special and even in certain circumstances evil objects at any rate if mankind is not to be led astray by such a universal rule of conduct it behooves it to attain a knowledge of the condition of culture that will serve as a scientific standard of comparison in connection with cosmical ends herein is comprised the tremendous mission of the great spirits of the next century reaction as progress occasionally harsh powerful impetuous yet nevertheless backward spirits appear who try to conjure back some past era in the history of mankind they serve as evidence that the new tendencies which they oppose are not yet potent enough that there is something lacking in them otherwise they the tendencies would better withstand the effects of this conjuring back process thus luther s reformation shows that in his century all the impulses to freedom of the spirit were still uncertain lacking in vigor and immature science could not yet rear her head indeed the whole renaissance appears but as an early spring smothered in snow but even in the present century schopenhauer s metaphysic shows that the scientific spirit is not yet powerful enough for the whole mediaeval christian world standpoint weltbetrachtung and conception of man mensch empfindung once again notwithstanding the slowly wrought destruction of all christian dogma celebrated a resurrection in schopenhauer s doctrine there is much science in his teaching although the science does not dominate but instead of it the old trite metaphysical necessity it is one of the greatest and most priceless advantages of schopenhauer s teaching that by it our feelings are temporarily forced back to those old human and cosmical standpoints to which no other path could conduct us so easily the gain for history and justice is very great i believe that without schopenhauer s aid it would be no easy matter for anyone now to do justice to christianity and its asiatic relatives a thing impossible as regards the christianity that still survives after according this great triumph to justice after we have corrected in so essential a respect the historical point of view which the age of learning brought with it we may begin to bear still farther onward the banner of enlightenment a banner bearing the three names petrarch erasmus voltaire we have taken a forward step out of reaction literally man feeling or human outlook a substitute for religion it is supposed to be a recommendation for philosophy to say of it that it provides the people with a substitute for religion and in fact the training of the intellect does necessitate the convenient laying out of the track of thought since the transition from religion by way of science entails a powerful perilous leap something that should be advised against with this qualification the recommendation referred to is a just one at the same time it should be further explained that the needs which religion satisfies and which science must now satisfy are not immutable even they can be diminished and uprooted think for instance of the christian soul need the sighs over one s inner corruption the anxiety regarding salvation all notions that arise simply out of errors of the reason and require no satisfaction at all but annihilation a philosophy can either so affect these needs as to appease them or else put them aside altogether for they are acquired circumscribed needs based upon hypotheses which those of science explode here for the purpose of affording the means of transition for the sake of lightening the spirit overburdened with feeling art can be employed to far better purpose as these hypotheses receive far less support from art than from a metaphysical philosophy then from art it is easier to go over to a really emancipating philosophical science discredited words away with the disgustingly over used words optimism and pessimism for the occasion for using them grows daily less only drivelers now find them indispensably necessary what earthly reason could anyone have for being an optimist unless he had a god to defend who must have created the best of all possible worlds since he is himself all goodness and perfection but what thinking man has now any need for the hypothesis that there is a god there is also no occasion whatever for a pessimistic confession of faith unless one has a personal interest in denouncing the advocate of god the theologian or the theological philosopher and maintaining the counter proposition that evil reigns that wretchedness is more potent than joy that the world is a piece of botch work that phenomenon erscheinung is but the manifestation of some evil spirit but who bothers his head about the theologians any more except the theologians themselves apart from all theology and its antagonism it is manifest that the world is neither good nor bad to say nothing about its being the best or the worst and that these ideas of good and bad have significance only in relation to men indeed are without significance at all in view of the sense in which they are usually employed the contemptuous and the eulogistic point of view must in every case be repudiated intoxicated by the perfume of flowers the ship of humanity it is thought acquires an ever deeper draught the more it is laden it is believed that the more profoundly man thinks the more exquisitely he feels the higher the standard he sets for himself the greater his distance from the other animals the more he appears as a genius genie among animals the nearer he gets to the true nature of the world and to comprehension thereof this indeed he really does through science but he thinks he does it far more adequately through his religions and arts these are certainly a blossoming of the world but not therefore nearer the roots of the world than is the stalk one cannot learn best from it the nature of the world although nearly everyone thinks so error has made men so deep sensitive and imaginative in order to bring forth such flowers as religions and arts pure apprehension would be unable to do that whoever should disclose to us the essence of the world would be undeceiving us most cruelly not the world as thing in itself but the world as idea as error is rich in portent deep wonderful carrying happiness and unhappiness in its womb this result leads to a philosophy of world negation which at any rate can be as well combined with a practical world affirmation as with its opposite vorstellung this word sometimes corresponds to the english word idea at others to conception or notion evil habits in reaching conclusions the most usual erroneous conclusions of men are these a thing exists therefore it is right here from capacity to live is deduced fitness from fitness is deduced justification so also an opinion gives happiness therefore it is the true one its effect is good therefore it is itself good and true here is predicated of the effect that it gives happiness that it is good in the sense of utility and there is likewise predicated of the cause that it is good but good in the sense of logical validity conversely the proposition would run a thing cannot attain success cannot maintain itself therefore it is evil a belief troubles the believer occasions pain therefore it is false the free spirit who is sensible of the defect in this method of reaching conclusions and has had to suffer its consequences often succumbs to the temptation to come to the very opposite conclusions which in general are of course equally erroneous a thing cannot maintain itself therefore it is good a belief is troublesome therefore it is true sache thing but not in the sense of ding sache is of very indefinite application res the illogical is necessary among the things which can bring a thinker to distraction is the knowledge that the illogical is necessary to mankind and that from the illogical springs much that is good the illogical is so imbedded in the passions in language in art in religion and above all in everything that imparts value to life that it cannot be taken away without irreparably injuring those beautiful things only men of the utmost simplicity can believe that the nature man knows can be changed into a purely logical nature yet were there steps affording approach to this goal how utterly everything would be lost on the way even the most rational man needs nature again from time to time that is his illogical fundamental relation grundstellung to all things being unjust is essential all judgments of the value of life are illogically developed and therefore unjust the vice of the judgment consists first in the way in which the subject matter comes under observation that is very incompletely secondly in the way in which the total is summed up and thirdly in the fact that each single item in the totality of the subject matter is itself the result of defective perception and this from absolute necessity no practical knowledge of a man for example stood he never so near to us can be complete so that we could have a logical right to form a total estimate of him all estimates are summary and must be so then the standard by which we measure our being is not an immutable quantity we have moods and variations and yet we should know ourselves as an invariable standard before we undertake to establish the nature of the relation of any thing sache to ourselves perhaps it will follow from all this that one should form no judgments whatever if one could but merely live without having to form estimates without aversion and without partiality for everything most abhorred is closely connected with an estimate as well as every strongest partiality an inclination towards a thing or from a thing without an accompanying feeling that the beneficial is desired and the pernicious contemned an inclination without a sort of experiential estimation of the desirability of an end does not exist in man we are primordially illogical and hence unjust beings and can recognise this fact this is one of the greatest and most baffling discords of existence error respecting living for the sake of living essential every belief in the value and worthiness of life rests upon defective thinking it is for this reason alone possible that sympathy with the general life and suffering of mankind is so imperfectly developed in the individual even exceptional men who can think beyond their own personalities do not have this general life in view but isolated portions of it if one is capable of fixing his observation upon exceptional cases i mean upon highly endowed individuals and pure souled beings if their development is taken as the true end of world evolution and if joy be felt in their existence then it is possible to believe in the value of life because in that case the rest of humanity is overlooked hence we have here defective thinking so too it is even if all mankind be taken into consideration and one species only of impulses the less egoistic brought under review and those in consideration of the other impulses exalted then something could still be hoped of mankind in the mass and to that extent there could exist belief in the value of life here again as a result of defective thinking whatever attitude thus one may assume one is as a result of this attitude an exception among mankind now the great majority of mankind endure life without any great protest and believe to this extent in the value of existence but that is because each individual decides and determines alone and never comes out of his own personality like these exceptions everything outside of the personal has no existence for them or at the utmost is observed as but a faint shadow consequently the value of life for the generality of mankind consists simply in the fact that the individual attaches more importance to himself than he does to the world the great lack of imagination from which he suffers is responsible for his inability to enter into the feelings of beings other than himself and hence his sympathy with their fate and suffering is of the slightest possible description on the other hand whosoever really could sympathise necessarily doubts the value of life were it possible for him to sum up and to feel in himself the total consciousness of mankind he would collapse with a malediction against existence for mankind is in the mass without a goal and hence man cannot find in the contemplation of his whole course anything to serve him as a mainstay and a comfort but rather a reason to despair if he looks beyond the things that immediately engage him to the final aimlessness of humanity his own conduct assumes in his eyes the character of a frittering away to feel oneself however as humanity not alone as an individual frittered away exactly as we see the stray leaves frittered away by nature is a feeling transcending all feeling but who is capable of it only a poet certainly and poets always know how to console themselves for tranquility but will not our philosophy become thus a tragedy will not truth prove the enemy of life of betterment a question seems to weigh upon our tongue and yet will not put itself into words whether one can knowingly remain in the domain of the untruthful or if one must whether then death would not be preferable for there is no longer any ought sollen morality so far as it is involved ought is through our point of view as utterly annihilated as religion our knowledge can permit only pleasure and pain benefit and injury to subsist as motives but how can these motives be distinguished from the desire for truth even they rest upon error in so far as already stated partiality and dislike and their very inaccurate estimates palpably modify our pleasure and our pain the whole of human life is deeply involved in untruth the individual cannot extricate it from this pit without thereby fundamentally clashing with his whole past without finding his present motives of conduct as that of honor illegitimate and without opposing scorn and contempt to the ambitions which prompt one to have regard for the future and for one s happiness in the future is it true does there then remain but one way of thinking which as a personal consequence brings in its train despair and as a theoretical consequence brings in its train a philosophy of decay disintegration self annihilation i believe the deciding influence as regards the after effect of knowledge will be the temperament of a man i can in addition to this after effect just mentioned suppose another by means of which a much simpler life and one freer from disturbances than the present could be lived so that at first the old motives of vehement passion might still have strength owing to hereditary habit but they would gradually grow weaker under the influence of purifying knowledge a man would live at last both among men and unto himself as in the natural state without praise reproach competition feasting one s eyes as if it were a play upon much that formerly inspired dread one would be rid of the strenuous element and would no longer feel the goad of the reflection that man is not even as much as nature nor more than nature to be sure this requires as already stated a good temperament a fortified gentle and naturally cheerful soul a disposition that has no need to be on its guard against its own eccentricities and sudden outbreaks and that in its utterances manifests neither sullenness nor a snarling tone those familiar disagreeable characteristics of old dogs and old men that have been a long time chained up rather must a man from whom the ordinary bondages of life have fallen away to so great an extent so do that he only lives on in order to grow continually in knowledge and to learn to resign without envy and without disappointment much yes nearly everything that has value in the eyes of men he must be content with such a free fearless soaring above men manners laws and traditional estimates of things as the most desirable of all situations he will freely share the joy of being in such a situation and he has perhaps nothing else to share in which renunciation and self denial really most consist but if more is asked of him he will with a benevolent shake of the head refer to his brother the free man of fact and will perhaps not dissemble a little contempt for as regards his freedom thereby hangs a tale den mit dessen freiheit hat es eine eigene bewandtniss history of the moral feelings advantages of psychological observation that reflection regarding the human all too human or as the learned jargon is psychological observation is among the means whereby the burden of life can be made lighter that practice in this art affords presence of mind in difficult situations and entertainment amid a wearisome environment aye that maxims may be culled in the thorniest and least pleasing paths of life and invigoration thereby obtained this much was believed was known in former centuries why was this forgotten in our own century during which at least in germany yes in europe poverty as regards psychological observation would have been manifest in many ways had there been anyone to whom this poverty could have manifested itself not only in the novel in the romance in philosophical standpoints these are the works of exceptional men still more in the state of opinion regarding public events and personages above all in general society which says much about men but nothing whatever about man there is totally lacking the art of psychological analysis and synthesis but why is the richest and most harmless source of entertainment thus allowed to run to waste why is the greatest master of the psychological maxim no longer read for with no exaggeration whatever be it said the educated person in europe who has read la rochefoucauld and his intellectual and artistic affinities is very hard to find still harder the person who knows them and does not disparage them apparently too this unusual reader takes far less pleasure in them than the form adopted by these artists should afford him for the subtlest mind cannot adequately appreciate the art of maxim making unless it has had training in it unless it has competed in it without such practical acquaintance one is apt to look upon this making and forming as a much easier thing than it really is one is not keenly enough alive to the felicity and the charm of success hence present day readers of maxims have but a moderate tempered pleasure in them scarcely indeed a true perception of their merit so that their experiences are about the same as those of the average beholder of cameos people who praise because they cannot appreciate and are very ready to admire and still readier to turn away objection or is there a counter proposition to the dictum that psychological observation is one of the means of consoling lightening charming existence have enough of the unpleasant effects of this art been experienced to justify the person striving for culture in turning his regard away from it in all truth a certain blind faith in the goodness of human nature an implanted distaste for any disparagement of human concerns a sort of shamefacedness at the nakedness of the soul may be far more desirable things in the general happiness of a man than this only occasionally advantageous quality of psychological sharpsightedness and perhaps belief in the good in virtuous men and actions in a plenitude of disinterested benevolence has been more productive of good in the world of men in so far as it has made men less distrustful if plutarch s heroes are enthusiastically imitated and a reluctance is experienced to looking too critically into the motives of their actions not the knowledge but the welfare of human society is promoted thereby psychological error and above all obtuseness in regard to it help human nature forward whereas knowledge of the truth is more promoted by means of the stimulating strength of a hypothesis as la rochefoucauld in the first edition of his sentences and moral maxims has expressed it what the world calls virtue is ordinarily but a phantom created by the passions and to which we give a good name in order to do whatever we please with impunity la rochefoucauld and those other french masters of soul searching to the number of whom has lately been added a german the author of psychological observations are like expert marksmen who again and again hit the black spot but it is the black spot in human nature their art inspires amazement but finally some spectator inspired not by the scientific spirit but by a humanitarian feeling execrates an art that seems to implant in the soul a taste for belittling and impeaching mankind nevertheless the matter therefore as regards pro and con stands thus in the present state of philosophy an awakening of the moral observation is essential the repulsive aspect of psychological dissection with the knife and tweezers entailed by the process can no longer be spared humanity such is the imperative duty of any science that investigates the origin and history of the so called moral feelings and which in its progress is called upon to posit and to solve advanced social problems the older philosophy does not recognize the newer at all and through paltry evasions has always gone astray in the investigation of the origin and history of human estimates werthsch tzungen with what results may now be very clearly perceived since it has been shown by many examples how the errors of the greatest philosophers have their origin in a false explanation of certain human actions and feelings how upon the foundation of an erroneous analysis for example of the so called disinterested actions a false ethic is reared to support which religion and like mythological monstrosities are called in until finally the shades of these troubled spirits collapse in physics and in the comprehensive world point of view but if it be established that superficiality of psychological observation has heretofore set the most dangerous snares for human judgment and deduction and will continue to do so all the greater need is there of that steady continuance of labor that never wearies putting stone upon stone little stone upon little stone all the greater need is there of a courage that is not ashamed of such humble labor and that will oppose persistence to all contempt it is finally also true that countless single observations concerning the human all too human have been first made and uttered in circles accustomed not to furnish matter for scientific knowledge but for intellectual pleasure seeking and the original home atmosphere a very seductive atmosphere of the moral maxim has almost inextricably interpenetrated the entire species so that the scientific man involuntarily manifests a sort of mistrust of this species and of its seriousness but it is sufficient to point to the consequences for already it is becoming evident that events of the most portentous nature are developing in the domain of psychological observation what is the leading conclusion arrived at by one of the subtlest and calmest of thinkers the author of the work concerning the origin of the moral feelings as a result of his thorough and incisive analysis of human conduct the moral man he says stands no nearer the knowable metaphysical world than the physical man this dictum grown hard and cutting beneath the hammer blow of historical knowledge can some day perhaps in some future or other serve as the axe that will be laid to the root of the metaphysical necessities of men whether more to the blessing than to the banning of universal well being who can say but in any event a dictum fraught with the most momentous consequences fruitful and fearful at once and confronting the world in the two faced way characteristic of all great facts der moralische mensch sagt er steht der intelligiblen metaphysischen welt nicht n her als der physische mensch to what extent useful therefore whether psychological observation is more an advantage than a disadvantage to mankind may always remain undetermined but there is no doubt that it is necessary because science can no longer dispense with it science however recognizes no considerations of ultimate goals or ends any more than nature does but as the latter duly matures things of the highest fitness for certain ends without any intention of doing it so will true science doing with ideas what nature does with matter promote the purposes and the welfare of humanity as occasion may afford and in many ways and attain fitness to ends but likewise without having intended it als die nachahmung der natur in begriffen literally as the counterfeit of nature in regard to ideas he to whom the atmospheric conditions of such a prospect are too wintry has too little fire in him let him look about him and he will become sensible of maladies requiring an icy air and of people who are so kneaded together out of ardor and intellect that they can scarcely find anywhere an atmosphere too cold and cutting for them moreover as too serious individuals and nations stand in need of trivial relaxations as others too volatile and excitable require onerous weighty ordeals to render them entirely healthy should not we the more intellectual men of this age which is swept more and more by conflagrations catch up every cooling and extinguishing appliance we can find that we may always remain as self contained steady and calm as we are now and thereby perhaps serve this age as its mirror and self reflector when the occasion arises the fable of discretionary freedom the history of the feelings on the basis of which we make everyone responsible hence the so called moral feelings is traceable in the following leading phases at first single actions are termed good or bad without any reference to their motive but solely because of the utilitarian or prejudicial consequences they have for the community in time however the origin of these designations is forgotten but it is imagined that action in itself without reference to its consequences contains the property good or bad with the same error according to which language designates the stone itself as hard ness the tree itself as green ness for the reason therefore that what is a consequence is comprehended as a cause accordingly the good ness or bad ness is incorporated into the motive and any deed by itself is regarded as morally ambiguous a step further is taken and the predication good or bad is no longer made of the particular motives but of the entire nature of a man out of which motive grows as grow the plants out of the soil thus man is successively made responsible for his particular acts then for his course of conduct then for his motives and finally for his nature now at last is it discovered that this nature even cannot be responsible inasmuch as it is only and wholly a necessary consequence and is synthesised out of the elements and influence of past and present things therefore that man is to be made responsible for nothing neither for his nature nor his motives nor his course of conduct nor his particular acts by this process is gained the knowledge that the history of moral estimates is the history of error of the error of responsibility as is whatever rests upon the error of the freedom of the will schopenhauer concluded just the other way thus since certain actions bring depression consciousness of guilt in their train there must then exist responsibility for there would be no basis for this depression at hand if all man s affairs did not follow their course of necessity as they do indeed according to the opinion of this philosopher follow their course but man himself subject to the same necessity would be just the man that he is which schopenhauer denies from the fact of such depression schopenhauer believes himself able to prove a freedom which man in some way must have had not indeed in regard to his actions but in regard to his nature freedom therefore to be thus and so not to act thus and so out of the esse the sphere of freedom and responsibility follows according to his opinion the operari the spheres of invariable causation necessity and irresponsibility this depression indeed is due apparently to the operari in so far as it be delusive but in truth to whatever esse be the deed of a free will the basic cause of the existence of an individual in order to let man become whatever he wills to become his to will wollen must precede his existence here apart from the absurdity of the statement just made there is drawn the wrong inference that the fact of the depression explains its character the rational admissibility of it from such a wrong inference does schopenhauer first come to his fantastic consequent of the so called discretionary freedom intelligibeln freiheit for the origin of this fabulous entity plato and kant are equally responsible but depression after the act does not need to be rational indeed it is certainly not so at all for it rests upon the erroneous assumption that the act need not necessarily have come to pass therefore only because man deems himself free but not because he is free does he experience remorse and the stings of conscience moreover this depression is something that can be grown out of in many men it is not present at all as a consequence of acts which inspire it in many other men it is a very varying thing and one closely connected with the development of custom and civilization and perhaps manifest only during a relatively brief period of the world s history no one is responsible for his acts no one for his nature to judge is tantamount to being unjust this applies as well when the individual judges himself the proposition is as clear as sunlight and yet here everyone prefers to go back to darkness and untruth for fear of the consequences above animal the beast in us must be wheedled ethic is necessary that we may not be torn to pieces without the errors involved in the assumptions of ethics man would have remained an animal thus has he taken himself as something higher and imposed rigid laws upon himself he feels hatred consequently for states approximating the animal whence the former contempt for the slave as a not yet man as a thing is to be explained unalterable character that character is unalterable is not in the strict sense true rather is this favorite proposition valid only to the extent that during the brief life period of a man the potent new motives can not usually press down hard enough to obliterate the lines imprinted by ages could we conceive of a man eighty thousand years old we should have in him an absolutely alterable character so that the maturities of successive varying individuals would develop in him the shortness of human life leads to many erroneous assertions concerning the qualities of man classification of enjoyments and ethic the once accepted comparative classification of enjoyments according to which an inferior higher highest egoism may crave one or another enjoyment now decides as to ethical status or unethical status a lower enjoyment for example sensual pleasure preferred to a more highly esteemed one for example health rates as unethical as does welfare preferred to freedom the comparative classification of enjoyments is not however alike or the same at all periods when anyone demands satisfaction of the law he is from the point of view of an earlier civilization moral from that of the present non moral unethical indicates therefore that a man is not sufficiently sensible to the higher finer impulses which the present civilization has brought with it or is not sensible to them at all it indicates backwardness but only from the point of view of the contemporary degree of distinction the comparative classification of enjoyments itself is not determined according to absolute ethics but after each new ethical adjustment it is then decided whether conduct be ethical or the reverse inhuman men as survivals men who are now inhuman must serve us as surviving specimens of earlier civilizations the mountain height of humanity here reveals its lower formations which might otherwise remain hidden from view there are surviving specimens of humanity whose brains through the vicissitudes of heredity have escaped proper development they show us what we all were and thus appal us but they are as little responsible on this account as is a piece of granite for being granite in our own brains there must be courses and windings corresponding to such characters just as in the forms of some human organs there survive traces of fishhood but these courses and windings are no longer the bed in which flows the stream of our feeling gratitude and revenge the reason the powerful man is grateful is this his benefactor has through his benefaction invaded the domain of the powerful man and established himself on an equal footing the powerful man in turn invades the domain of the benefactor and gets satisfaction through the act of gratitude it is a mild form of revenge by not obtaining the satisfaction of gratitude the powerful would have shown himself powerless and have ranked as such thenceforward hence every society of the good that is to say of the powerful originally places gratitude among the first of duties swift has added the dictum that man is grateful in the same degree that he is revengeful two fold historical origin of good and evil the notion of good and bad has a two fold historical origin namely first in the spirit of ruling races and castes whoever has power to requite good with good and evil with evil and actually brings requital that is is grateful and revengeful acquires the name of being good whoever is powerless and cannot requite is called bad a man belongs as a good individual to the good of a community who have a feeling in common because all the individuals are allied with one another through the requiting sentiment a man belongs as a bad individual to the bad to a mass of subjugated powerless men who have no feeling in common the good are a caste the bad are a quantity like dust good and bad is for a considerable period tantamount to noble and servile master and slave on the other hand an enemy is not looked upon as bad he can requite the trojan and the greek are in homer both good not he who does no harm but he who is despised is deemed bad in the community of the good individuals the quality of good ness is inherited it is impossible for a bad individual to grow from such a rich soil if notwithstanding one of the good individuals does something unworthy of his goodness recourse is had to exorcism thus the guilt is ascribed to a deity the while it is declared that this deity bewitched the good man into madness and blindness second in the spirit of the subjugated the powerless here every other man is to the individual hostile inconsiderate greedy inhuman avaricious be he noble or servile bad is the characteristic term for man for every living being indeed that is recognized at all even for a god human divine these notions are tantamount to devilish bad manifestations of goodness sympathy helpfulness are regarded with anxiety as trickiness preludes to an evil end deception subtlety in short as refined badness with such a predisposition in individuals a feeling in common can scarcely arise at all at most only the rudest form of it so that everywhere that this conception of good and evil prevails the destruction of the individuals their race and nation is imminent our existing morality has developed upon the foundation laid by ruling races and castes sympathy greater than suffering there are circumstances in which sympathy is stronger than the suffering itself we feel more pain for instance when one of our friends becomes guilty of a reprehensible action than if we had done the deed ourselves we once that is had more faith in the purity of his character than he had himself hence our love for him apparently because of this very faith is stronger than is his own love for himself if indeed his egoism really suffers more as a result than our egoism inasmuch as he must take the consequences of his fault to a greater extent than ourselves nevertheless the unegoistic this word is not to be taken too strictly but simply as a modified form of expression in us is more affected by his guilt than the unegoistic in him hypochondria there are people who from sympathy and anxiety for others become hypochondriacal the resulting form of compassion is nothing else than sickness so also is there a christian hypochondria from which those singular religiously agitated people suffer who place always before their eyes the suffering and death of christ economy of blessings the advantageous and the pleasing as the healthiest growths and powers in the intercourse of men are such precious treasures that it is much to be wished the use made of these balsamic means were as economical as possible but this is impossible economy in the use of blessings is the dream of the craziest of utopians well wishing among the small but infinitely plentiful and therefore very potent things to which science must pay more attention than to the great uncommon things well wishing must be reckoned i mean those manifestations of friendly disposition in intercourse that laughter of the eye every hand pressure every courtesy from which in general every human act gets its quality every teacher every functionary adds this element as a gratuity to whatever he does as a duty it is the perpetual well spring of humanity like the waves of light in which everything grows thus in the narrowest circles within the family life blooms and flowers only through this kind feeling the cheerfulness friendliness and kindness of a heart are unfailing sources of unegoistic impulse and have made far more for civilization than those other more noised manifestations of it that are styled sympathy benevolence and sacrifice but it is customary to depreciate these little tokens of kindly feeling and indeed there is not much of the unegoistic in them the sum of these little doses is very great nevertheless their combined strength is of the greatest of strengths thus too much more happiness is to be found in the world than gloomy eyes discover that is if the calculation be just and all these pleasing moments in which every day even the meanest human life is rich be not forgotten wohl wollen kind feeling it stands here for benevolence but not benevolence in the restricted sense of the word now prevailing the desire to inspire compassion la rochefoucauld in the most notable part of his self portraiture first printed reaches the vital spot of truth when he warns all those endowed with reason to be on their guard against compassion when he advises that this sentiment be left to men of the masses who stand in need of the promptings of the emotions since they are not guided by reason to induce them to give aid to the suffering and to be of service in misfortune whereas compassion in his and plato s view deprives the heart of strength to be sure sympathy should be manifested but men should take care not to feel it for the unfortunate are rendered so dull that the manifestation of sympathy affords them the greatest happiness in the world perhaps a more effectual warning against this compassion can be given if this need of the unfortunate be considered not simply as stupidity and intellectual weakness not as a sort of distraction of the spirit entailed by misfortune itself and thus indeed does la rochefoucauld seem to view it but as something quite different and more momentous let note be taken of children who cry and scream in order to be compassionated and who therefore await the moment when their condition will be observed come into contact with the sick and the oppressed in spirit and try to ascertain if the wailing and sighing the posturing and posing of misfortune do not have as end and aim the causing of pain to the beholder the sympathy which each beholder manifests is a consolation to the weak and suffering only in as much as they are made to perceive that at least they have the power notwithstanding all their weakness to inflict pain the unfortunate experiences a species of joy in the sense of superiority which the manifestation of sympathy entails his imagination is exalted he is always strong enough then to cause the world pain thus is the thirst for sympathy a thirst for self enjoyment and at the expense of one s fellow creatures it shows man in the whole ruthlessness of his own dear self not in his mere dullness as la rochefoucauld thinks in social conversation three fourths of all the questions are asked and three fourths of all the replies are made in order to inflict some little pain that is why so many people crave social intercourse it gives them a sense of their power in these countless but very small doses in which the quality of badness is administered it proves a potent stimulant of life to the same extent that well wishing wohl wollen distributed through the world in like manner is one of the ever ready restoratives but will many honorable people be found to admit that there is any pleasure in administering pain that entertainment and rare entertainment is not seldom found in causing others at least in thought some pain and in raking them with the small shot of wickedness the majority are too ignoble and a few are too good to know anything of this pudendum the latter may consequently be prompt to deny that prosper m rim e is right when he says know also that nothing is more common than to do wrong for the pleasure of doing it how appearance becomes reality the actor cannot at last refrain even in moments of the deepest pain from thinking of the effect produced by his deportment and by his surroundings for example even at the funeral of his own child he will weep at his own sorrow and its manifestations as though he were his own audience the hypocrite who always plays one and the same part finally ceases to be a hypocrite as in the case of priests who when young men are always either consciously or unconsciously hypocrites and finally become naturally and then really without affectation mere priests or if the father does not carry it to this extent the son who inherits his father s calling and gets the advantage of the paternal progress does when anyone during a long period and persistently wishes to appear something it will at last prove difficult for him to be anything else the calling of almost every man even of the artist begins with hypocrisy with an imitation of deportment with a copying of the effective in manner he who always wears the mask of a friendly man must at last gain a power over friendliness of disposition without which the expression itself of friendliness is not to be gained and finally friendliness of disposition gains the ascendancy over him he is benevolent the point of honor in deception in all great deceivers one characteristic is prominent to which they owe their power in the very act of deception amid all the accompaniments the agitation in the voice the expression the bearing in the crisis of the scene there comes over them a belief in themselves this it is that acts so effectively and irresistibly upon the beholders founders of religions differ from such great deceivers in that they never come out of this state of self deception or else they have very rarely a few moments of enlightenment in which they are overcome by doubt generally however they soothe themselves by ascribing such moments of enlightenment to the evil adversary self deception must exist that both classes of deceivers may attain far reaching results for men believe in the truth of all that is manifestly believed with due implicitness by others presumed degrees of truth one of the most usual errors of deduction is because someone truly and openly is against us therefore he speaks the truth hence the child has faith in the judgments of its elders the christian in the assertions of the founder of the church so too it will not be admitted that all for which men sacrificed life and happiness in former centuries was nothing but delusion perhaps it is alleged these things were degrees of truth but what is really meant is that if a person sincerely believes a thing and has fought and died for his faith it would be too unjust if only delusion had inspired him such a state of affairs seems to contradict eternal justice for that reason the heart of a sensitive man pronounces against his head the judgment between moral conduct and intellectual insight there must always exist an inherent connection it is unfortunately otherwise for there is no eternal justice falsehood why do men as a rule speak the truth in the ordinary affairs of life certainly not for the reason that a god has forbidden lying but because first it is more convenient as falsehood entails invention make believe and recollection wherefore swift says that whoever invents a lie seldom realises the heavy burden he takes up he must namely for every lie that he tells insert twenty more therefore because in plain ordinary relations of life it is expedient to say without circumlocution i want this i have done this and the like therefore because the way of freedom and certainty is surer than that of ruse but if it happens that a child is brought up in sinister domestic circumstances it will then indulge in falsehood as matter of course and involuntarily say anything its own interests may prompt an inclination for truth an aversion to falsehood is quite foreign and uncongenial to it and hence it lies in all innocence ethic discredited for faith s sake no power can sustain itself when it is represented by mere humbugs the catholic church may possess ever so many worldly sources of strength but its true might is comprised in those still numberless priestly natures who make their lives stern and strenuous and whose looks and emaciated bodies are eloquent of night vigils fasts ardent prayer perhaps even of whip lashes these things make men tremble and cause them anxiety what if it be really imperative to live thus this is the dreadful question which their aspect occasions as they spread this doubt they lay anew the prop of their power even the free thinkers dare not oppose such disinterestedness with severe truth and cry thou deceived one deceive not only the difference of standpoint separates them from him no difference in goodness or badness but things we cannot accomplish ourselves we are apt to criticise unfairly thus we are told of the cunning and perverted acts of the jesuits but we overlook the self mastery that each jesuit imposes upon himself and also the fact that the easy life which the jesuit manuals advocate is for the benefit not of the jesuits but the laity indeed it may be questioned whether we enlightened ones would become equally competent workers as the result of similar tactics and organization and equally worthy of admiration as the result of self mastery indefatigable industry and devotion victory of knowledge over radical evil it proves a material gain to him who would attain knowledge to have had during a considerable period the idea that mankind is a radically bad and perverted thing it is a false idea as is its opposite but it long held sway and its roots have reached down even to ourselves and our present world in order to understand ourselves we must understand it but in order to attain a loftier height we must step above it we then perceive that there is no such thing as sin in the metaphysical sense but also in the same sense no such thing as virtue that this whole domain of ethical notions is one of constant variation that there are higher and deeper conceptions of good and evil moral and immoral whoever desires no more of things than knowledge of them attains speedily to peace of mind and will at most err through lack of knowledge but scarcely through eagerness for knowledge or through sin as the world calls it he will not ask that eagerness for knowledge be interdicted and rooted out but his single all powerful ambition to know as thoroughly and as fully as possible will soothe him and moderate all that is strenuous in his circumstances moreover he is now rid of a number of disturbing notions he is no longer beguiled by such words as hell pain sinfulness unworthiness he sees in them merely the flitting shadow pictures of false views of life and of the world ethic as man s self analysis a good author whose heart is really in his work wishes that someone would arise and wholly refute him if only thereby his subject be wholly clarified and made plain the maid in love wishes that she could attest the fidelity of her own passion through the faithlessness of her beloved the soldier wishes to sacrifice his life on the field of his fatherland s victory for in the victory of his fatherland his highest end is attained the mother gives her child what she deprives herself of sleep the best nourishment and in certain circumstances her health her self but are all these acts unegoistic are these moral deeds miracles because they are in schopenhauer s phrase impossible and yet accomplished is it not evident that in all four cases man loves one part of himself a thought a longing an experience more than he loves another part of himself that he thus analyses his being and sacrifices one part of it to another part is this essentially different from the behavior of the obstinate man who says i would rather be shot than go a step out of my way for this fellow preference for something wish impulse longing is present in all four instances to yield to it with all its consequences is not unegoistic in the domain of the ethical man conducts himself not as individuum but as dividuum what can be promised actions can be promised but not feelings for these are involuntary whoever promises somebody to love him always or to hate him always or to be ever true to him promises something that it is out of his power to bestow but he really can promise such courses of conduct as are the ordinary accompaniments of love of hate of fidelity but which may also have their source in motives quite different for various ways and motives lead to the same conduct the promise to love someone always means consequently as long as i love you i will manifest the deportment of love but if i cease to love you my deportment although from some other motive will be just the same so that to the people about us it will seem as if my love remained unchanged hence it is the continuance of the deportment of love that is promised in every instance in which eternal love provided no element of self deception be involved is sworn intellect and ethic one must have a good memory to be able to keep the promises one makes one must have a strong imagination in order to feel sympathy so closely is ethics connected with intellectual capacity desire for vengeance and vengeance itself to meditate revenge and attain it is tantamount to an attack of fever that passes away but to meditate revenge without possessing the strength or courage to attain it is tantamount to suffering from a chronic malady or poisoning of body and soul ethics which takes only the motive into account rates both cases alike people generally estimate the first case as the worst because of the consequences which the deed of vengeance may entail both views are short sighted ability to wait ability to wait is so hard to acquire that great poets have not disdained to make inability to wait the central motive of their poems so shakespeare in othello sophocles in ajax whose suicide would not have seemed to him so imperative had he only been able to cool his ardor for a day as the oracle foreboded apparently he would then have repulsed somewhat the fearful whispers of distracted thought and have said to himself who has not already in my situation mistaken a sheep for a hero is it so extraordinary a thing on the contrary it is something universally human ajax should thus have soothed himself passion will not wait the tragic element in the lives of great men does not generally consist in their conflict with time and the inferiority of their fellowmen but in their inability to put off their work a year or two they cannot wait in all duels the friends who advise have but to ascertain if the principals can wait if this be not possible a duel is rational inasmuch as each of the combatants may say either i continue to live and the other dies instantly or vice versa to wait in such circumstances would be equivalent to the frightful martyrdom of enduring dishonor in the presence of him responsible for the dishonor and this can easily cost more anguish than life is worth glutting revenge coarse men who feel a sense of injury are in the habit of rating the extent of their injury as high as possible and of stating the occasion of it in greatly exaggerated language in order to be able to feast themselves on the sentiments of hatred and revenge thus aroused value of disparagement not a few perhaps the majority of men find it necessary in order to retain their self esteem and a certain uprightness in conduct to mentally disparage and belittle all the people they know but as the inferior natures are in the majority and as a great deal depends upon whether they retain or lose this uprightness so the man in a rage we should be on our guard against the man who is enraged against us as against one who has attempted our life for the fact that we still live consists solely in the inability to kill were looks sufficient it would have been all up with us long since to reduce anyone to silence by physical manifestations of savagery or by a terrorizing process is a relic of under civilization so too that cold look which great personages cast upon their servitors is a remnant of the caste distinction between man and man a specimen of rude antiquity women the conservers of the old have maintained this survival too more perfectly than men whither honesty may lead someone once had the bad habit of expressing himself upon occasion and with perfect honesty on the subject of the motives of his conduct which were as good or as bad as the motives of all men he aroused first disfavor then suspicion became gradually of ill repute and was pronounced a person of whom society should beware until at last the law took note of such a perverted being for reasons which usually have no weight with it or to which it closes its eyes lack of taciturnity concerning what is universally held secret and an irresponsible predisposition to see what no one wants to see oneself brought him to prison and to early death punishable not punished our crime against criminals consists in the fact that we treat them as rascals sancta simplicitas of virtue every virtue has its privilege for example that of contributing its own little bundle of wood to the funeral pyre of one condemned morality and consequence not alone the beholders of an act generally estimate the ethical or unethical element in it by the result no the one who performed the act does the same for the motives and the intentions are seldom sufficiently apparent and amid them the memory itself seems to become clouded by the results of the act so that a man often ascribes the wrong motives to his acts or regards the remote motives as the direct ones success often imparts to an action all the brilliance and honor of good intention while failure throws the shadow of conscience over the most estimable deeds hence arises the familiar maxim of the politician give me only success with it i can win all the noble souls over to my side and make myself noble even in my own eyes in like manner will success prove an excellent substitute for a better argument to this very day many well educated men think the triumph of christianity over greek philosophy is a proof of the superior truth of the former although in this case it was simply the coarser and more powerful that triumphed over the more delicate and intellectual as regards superiority of truth it is evident that because of it the reviving sciences have connected themselves point for point with the philosophy of epicurus while christianity has point for point recoiled from it love and justice why is love so highly prized at the expense of justice and why are such beautiful things spoken of the former as if it were a far higher entity than the latter is the former not palpably a far more stupid thing than the latter certainly and on that very account so much the more agreeable to everybody it is blind and has a rich horn of plenty out of which it distributes its gifts to everyone even when they are unmerited even when no thanks are returned it is impartial like the rain which according to the bible and experience wets not alone the unjust but in certain circumstances the just as well and to their skins at that execution how comes it that every execution causes us more pain than a murder it is the coolness of the executioner the painful preparation the perception that here a man is being used as an instrument for the intimidation of others for the guilt is not punished even if there be any this is ascribable to the teachers the parents the environment in ourselves not in the murderer i mean the predisposing circumstances hope pandora brought the box containing evils and opened it it was the gift of the gods to men a gift of most enticing appearance externally and called the box of happiness thereupon all the evils living moving things flew out from that time to the present they fly about and do ill to men by day and night one evil only did not fly out of the box pandora shut the lid at the behest of zeus and it remained inside now man has this box of happiness perpetually in the house and congratulates himself upon the treasure inside of it it is at his service he grasps it whenever he is so disposed for he knows not that the box which pandora brought was a box of evils hence he looks upon the one evil still remaining as the greatest source of happiness it is hope zeus intended that man notwithstanding the evils oppressing him should continue to live and not rid himself of life but keep on making himself miserable for this purpose he bestowed hope upon man it is in truth the greatest of evils for it lengthens the ordeal of man degree of moral susceptibility unknown the fact that one has or has not had certain profoundly moving impressions and insights into things for example an unjustly executed slain or martyred father a faithless wife a shattering serious accident is the factor upon which the excitation of our passions to white heat principally depends as well as the course of our whole lives no one knows to what lengths circumstances sympathy emotion may lead him he does not know the full extent of his own susceptibility wretched environment makes him wretched it is as a rule not the quality of our experience but its quantity upon which depends the development of our superiority or inferiority from the point of view of good and evil the martyr against his will in a certain movement there was a man who was too cowardly and vacillating ever to contradict his comrades he was made use of in each emergency every sacrifice was demanded of him because he feared the disfavor of his comrades more than he feared death he was a petty abject spirit they perceived this and upon the foundation of the qualities just mentioned they elevated him to the altitude of a hero and finally even of a martyr although the cowardly creature always inwardly said no he always said yes with his lips even upon the scaffold where he died for the tenets of his party for beside him stood one of his old associates who so domineered him with look and word that he actually went to his death with the utmost fortitude and has ever since been celebrated as a martyr and exalted character general standard one will rarely err if extreme actions be ascribed to vanity ordinary actions to habit and mean actions to fear misunderstanding of virtue whoever has obtained his experience of vice in connection with pleasure as in the case of one with a youth of wild oats behind him comes to the conclusion that virtue must be connected with self denial whoever on the other hand has been very much plagued by his passions and vices longs to find in virtue the rest and peace of the soul that is why it is possible for two virtuous people to misunderstand one another wholly the ascetic the ascetic makes out of virtue a slavery honor transferred from persons to things actions prompted by love or by the spirit of self sacrifice for others are universally honored wherever they are manifest hence is magnified the value set upon whatever things may be loved or whatever things conduce to self sacrifice although in themselves they may be worth nothing much a valiant army is evidence of the value of the thing it fights for ambition a substitute for moral feeling moral feeling should never become extinct in natures that are destitute of ambition the ambitious can get along without moral feeling just as well as with it hence the sons of retired ambitionless families generally become by a series of rapid gradations when they lose moral feeling the most absolute lunkheads vanity enriches how poor the human mind would be without vanity as it is it resembles a well stacked and ever renewed ware emporium that attracts buyers of every class they can find almost everything have almost everything provided they bring with them the right kind of money admiration senility and death apart from the demands made by religion it may well be asked why it is more honorable in an aged man who feels the decline of his powers to await slow extinction than to fix a term to his existence himself suicide in such a case is a quite natural and due proceeding that ought to command respect as a triumph of reason and did in fact command respect during the times of the masters of greek philosophy and the bravest roman patriots who usually died by their own hand eagerness on the other hand to keep alive from day to day with the anxious counsel of physicians without capacity to attain any nearer to one s ideal of life is far less worthy of respect religions are very rich in refuges from the mandate of suicide hence they ingratiate themselves with those who cling to life delusions regarding victim and regarding evil doer when the rich man takes a possession away from the poor man for example a prince who deprives a plebeian of his beloved there arises in the mind of the poor man a delusion he thinks the rich man must be wholly perverted to take from him the little that he has but the rich man appreciates the value of a single possession much less because he is accustomed to many possessions so that he cannot put himself in the place of the poor man and does not act by any means as ill as the latter supposes both have a totally false idea of each other the iniquities of the mighty which bulk most largely in history are not nearly so monstrous as they seem the hereditary consciousness of being a superior being with superior environment renders one very callous and lulls the conscience to rest we all feel when the difference between ourselves and some other being is exceedingly great that no element of injustice can be involved and we kill a fly with no qualms of conscience whatever so too it is no indication of wickedness in xerxes whom even the greeks represent as exceptionally noble that he deprived a father of his son and had him drawn and quartered because the latter had manifested a troublesome ominous distrust of an entire expedition the individual was in this case brushed aside as a pestiferous insect he was too low and mean to justify continued sentiments of compunction in the ruler of the world indeed no cruel man is ever as cruel in the main as his victim thinks the idea of pain is never the same as the sensation the rule is precisely analogous in the case of the unjust judge and of the journalist who by means of devious rhetorical methods leads public opinion astray cause and effect are in all these instances entwined with totally different series of feeling and thoughts whereas it is unconsciously assumed that principal and victim feel and think exactly alike and because of this assumption the guilt of the one is based upon the pain of the other the soul s skin as the bones flesh entrails and blood vessels are enclosed by a skin that renders the aspect of men endurable so the impulses and passions of the soul are enclosed by vanity it is the skin of the soul sleep of virtue if virtue goes to sleep it will be more vigorous when it awakes subtlety of shame men are not ashamed of obscene thoughts but they are ashamed when they suspect that obscene thoughts are attributed to them naughtiness is rare most people are too much absorbed in themselves to be bad the mite in the balance we are praised or blamed as the one or the other may be expedient for displaying to advantage our power of discernment luke improved he that humbleth himself wisheth to be exalted prevention of suicide there is a justice according to which we may deprive a man of life but none that permits us to deprive him of death this is merely cruelty vanity we set store by the good opinion of men first because it is of use to us and next because we wish to give them pleasure children their parents pupils their teacher and well disposed persons all others generally only when the good opinion of men is important to somebody apart from personal advantage or the desire to give pleasure do we speak of vanity in this last case a man wants to give himself pleasure but at the expense of his fellow creatures inasmuch as he inspires them with a false opinion of himself or else inspires good opinion in such a way that it is a source of pain to others by arousing envy the individual generally seeks through the opinion of others to attest and fortify the opinion he has of himself but the potent influence of authority an influence as old as man himself leads many also to strengthen their own opinion of themselves by means of authority that is to borrow from others the expedient of relying more upon the judgment of their fellow men than upon their own interest in oneself the wish to please oneself attains with the vain man such proportions that he first misleads others into a false unduly exalted estimate of himself and then relies upon the authority of others for his self estimate he thus creates the delusion that he pins his faith to it must however be admitted that the vain man does not desire to please others so much as himself and he will often go so far on this account as to overlook his own interests for he often inspires his fellow creatures with malicious envy and renders them ill disposed in order that he may thus increase his own delight in himself limits of the love of mankind every man who has declared that some other man is an ass or a scoundrel gets angry when the other man conclusively shows that the assertion was erroneous weeping morality how much delight morality occasions think of the ocean of pleasing tears that has flowed from the narration of noble great hearted deeds this charm of life would disappear if the belief in complete irresponsibility gained the upper hand origin of justice justice reasonableness has its origin among approximate equals in power as thucydides in the dreadful conferences of the athenian and melian envoys has rightly conceived thus where there exists no demonstrable supremacy and a struggle leads but to mutual useless damage the reflection arises that an understanding would best be arrived at and some compromise entered into the reciprocal nature is hence the first nature of justice each party makes the other content inasmuch as each receives what it prizes more highly than the other each surrenders to the other what the other wants and receives in return its own desire justice is therefore reprisal and exchange upon the basis of an approximate equality of power thus revenge pertains originally to the domain of justice as it is a sort of reciprocity equally so gratitude justice reverts naturally to the standpoint of self preservation therefore to the egoism of this consideration why should i injure myself to no purpose and perhaps never attain my end so much for the origin of justice only because men through mental habits have forgotten the original motive of so called just and rational acts and also because for thousands of years children have been brought to admire and imitate such acts have they gradually assumed the appearance of being unegotistical upon this appearance is founded the high estimate of them which moreover like all estimates is continually developing for whatever is highly esteemed is striven for imitated made the object of self sacrifice while the merit of the pain and emulation thus expended is by each individual ascribed to the thing esteemed how slightly moral would the world appear without forgetfulness a poet could say that god had posted forgetfulness as a sentinel at the portal of the temple of human merit concerning the law of the weaker whenever any party for instance a besieged city yields to a stronger party under stipulated conditions the counter stipulation is that there be a reduction to insignificance a burning and destruction of the city and thus a great damage inflicted upon the stronger party thus arises a sort of equalization principle upon the basis of which a law can be established the enemy has an advantage to gain by its maintenance to this extent there is also a law between slaves and masters limited only by the extent to which the slave may be useful to his master the law goes originally only so far as the one party may appear to the other potent invincible stable and the like to such an extent then the weaker has rights but very limited ones hence the famous dictum that each has as much law on his side as his power extends or more accurately as his power is believed to extend the three phases of morality hitherto it is the first evidence that the animal has become human when his conduct ceases to be based upon the immediately expedient but upon the permanently useful when he has therefore grown utilitarian capable of purpose thus is manifested the first rule of reason a still higher stage is attained when he regulates his conduct upon the basis of honor by means of which he gains mastery of himself and surrenders his desires to principles this lifts him far above the phase in which he was actuated only by considerations of personal advantage as he understood it he respects and wishes to be respected this means that he comprehends utility as a thing dependent upon what his opinion of others is and their opinion of him finally he regulates his conduct the highest phase of morality hitherto attained by his own standard of men and things he himself decides for himself and for others what is honorable and what is useful he has become a law giver to opinion upon the basis of his ever higher developing conception of the utilitarian and the honorable knowledge makes him capable of placing the highest utility that is the universal enduring utility before merely personal utility of placing ennobling recognition of the enduring and universal before the merely temporary he lives and acts as a collective individuality ethic of the developed individual hitherto the altruistic has been looked upon as the distinctive characteristic of moral conduct and it is manifest that it was the consideration of universal utility that prompted praise and recognition of altruistic conduct must not a radical departure from this point of view be imminent now that it is being ever more clearly perceived that in the most personal considerations the most general welfare is attained so that conduct inspired by the most personal considerations of advantage is just the sort which has its origin in the present conception of morality as a universal utilitarianism to contemplate oneself as a complete personality and bear the welfare of that personality in mind in all that one does this is productive of better results than any sympathetic susceptibility and conduct in behalf of others indeed we all suffer from such disparagement of our own personalities which are at present made to deteriorate from neglect capacity is in fact divorced from our personality in most cases and sacrificed to the state to science to the needy as if it were the bad which deserved to be made a sacrifice now we are willing to labor for our fellowmen but only to the extent that we find our own highest advantage in so doing no more no less the whole matter depends upon what may be understood as one s advantage the crude undeveloped rough individualities will be the very ones to estimate it most inadequately usage and ethic to be moral virtuous praiseworthy means to yield obedience to ancient law and hereditary usage whether this obedience be rendered readily or with difficulty is long immaterial enough that it be rendered good finally comes to mean him who acts in the traditional manner as a result of heredity or natural disposition that is to say does what is customary with scarcely an effort whatever that may be for example revenges injuries when revenge as with the ancient greeks was part of good morals he is called good because he is good to some purpose and as benevolence sympathy considerateness moderation and the like come in the general course of conduct to be finally recognized as good to some purpose as utilitarian the benevolent man the helpful man is duly styled good at first other and more important kinds of utilitarian qualities stand in the foreground bad is not habitual unusual to do things not in accordance with usage to oppose the traditional however rational or the reverse the traditional may be to do injury to one s social group or community and to one s neighbor as thus understood is looked upon through all the variations of moral laws in different ages as the peculiarly immoral act so that to day we associate the word bad with deliberate injury to one s neighbor or community egoistic and non egoistic do not constitute the fundamental opposites that have brought mankind to make a distinction between moral and immoral good and bad but adherence to traditional custom and emancipation from it how the traditional had its origin is quite immaterial in any event it had no reference to good and bad or any categorical imperative but to the all important end of maintaining and sustaining the community the race the confederation the nation every superstitious custom that originated in a misinterpreted event or casualty entailed some tradition to adhere to which is moral to break loose from it is dangerous more prejudicial to the community than to the individual because divinity visits the consequences of impiety and sacrilege upon the community rather than upon the individual now every tradition grows ever more venerable the more remote is its origin the more confused that origin is the reverence due to it increases from generation to generation the tradition finally becomes holy and inspires awe thus it is that the precept of piety is a far loftier morality than that inculcated by altruistic conduct delight in the moral a potent species of joy and thereby the source of morality is custom the customary is done more easily better therefore preferably a pleasure is felt in it and experience thus shows that since this practice has held its own it must be good a manner or moral that lives and lets live is thus demonstrated advantageous necessary in contradistinction to all new and not yet adopted practices the custom is therefore the blending of the agreeable and the useful moreover it does not require deliberation as soon as man can exercise compulsion he exercises it to enforce and establish his customs for they are to him attested lifewisdom so too a community of individuals constrains each one of their number to adopt the same moral or custom the error herein is this because a certain custom has been agreeable to the feelings or at least because it proves a means of maintenance this custom must be imperative for it is regarded as the only thing that can possibly be consistent with well being the well being of life seems to spring from it alone this conception of the customary as a condition of existence is carried into the slightest detail of morality inasmuch as insight into true causation is quite restricted in all inferior peoples a superstitious anxiety is felt that everything be done in due routine even when a custom is exceedingly burdensome it is preserved because of its supposed vital utility it is not known that the same degree of satisfaction can be experienced through some other custom and even higher degrees of satisfaction too but it is fully appreciated that all customs do become more agreeable with the lapse of time no matter how difficult they may have been found in the beginning and that even the severest way of life may be rendered a matter of habit and therefore a pleasure pleasure and social instinct through his relations with other men man derives a new species of delight in those pleasurable emotions which his own personality affords him whereby the domain of pleasurable emotions is made infinitely more comprehensive no doubt he has inherited many of these feelings from the brutes which palpably feel delight when they sport with one another as mothers with their young so too the sexual relations must be taken into account they make every young woman interesting to every young man from the standpoint of pleasure and conversely the feeling of pleasure originating in human relationships makes men in general better the delight in common the pleasures enjoyed together heighten one another the individual feels a sense of security he becomes better natured distrust and malice dissolve for the man feels the sense of benefit and observes the same feeling in others mutual manifestations of pleasure inspire mutual sympathy the sentiment of homogeneity the same effect is felt also at mutual sufferings in a common danger in stormy weather upon such a foundation are built the earliest alliances the object of which is the mutual protection and safety from threatening misfortunes and the welfare of each individual and thus the social instinct develops from pleasure the guiltless nature of so called bad acts all bad acts are inspired by the impulse to self preservation or more accurately by the desire for pleasure and for the avoidance of pain in the individual thus are they occasioned but they are not therefore bad pain self prepared does not exist except in the brains of the philosophers any more than pleasure self prepared sympathy in the schopenhauer sense in the condition anterior to the state we kill the creature be it man or ape that attempts to pluck the fruit of a tree before we pluck it ourselves should we happen to be hungry at the time and making for that tree as we would do to day so far as the brute is concerned if we were wandering in savage regions the bad acts which most disturb us at present do so because of the erroneous supposition that the one who is guilty of them towards us has a free will in the matter and that it was within his discretion not to have done these evil things this belief in discretionary power inspires hate thirst for revenge malice the entire perversion of the mental processes whereas we would feel in no way incensed against the brute as we hold it irresponsible to inflict pain not from the instinct of self preservation but in requital this is the consequence of false judgment and is equally a guiltless course of conduct the individual can in that condition which is anterior to the state act with fierceness and violence for the intimidation of another creature in order to render his own power more secure as a result of such acts of intimidation thus acts the powerful the superior the original state founder who subjugates the weaker he has the right to do so as the state nowadays assumes the same right or to be more accurate there is no right that can conflict with this a foundation for all morality can first be laid only when a stronger individuality or a collective individuality for example society the state subjects the single personalities hence builds upon their unification and establishes a bond of union morality results from compulsion it is indeed itself one long compulsion to which obedience is rendered in order that pain may be avoided at first it is but custom later free obedience and finally almost instinct at last it is like everything habitual and natural associated with pleasure and is then called virtue shame shame exists wherever a mystery exists but this is a religious notion which in the earlier period of human civilization had great vogue everywhere there were circumscribed spots to which access was denied on account of some divine law except in special circumstances at first these spots were quite extensive inasmuch as stipulated areas could not be trod by the uninitiated who when near them felt tremors and anxieties this sentiment was frequently transferred to other relationships for example to sexual relations which as the privilege and gateway of mature age must be withdrawn from the contemplation of youth for its own advantage relations which many divinities were busy in preserving and sanctifying images of which divinities were duly placed in marital chambers as guardians in turkish such an apartment is termed a harem or holy thing the same word also designating the vestibule of a mosque so too kingship is regarded as a centre from which power and brilliance stream forth as a mystery to the subjects impregnated with secrecy and shame sentiments still quite operative among peoples who in other respects are without any shame at all so too is the whole world of inward states the so called soul even now for all non philosophical persons a mystery and during countless ages it was looked upon as a something of divine origin in direct communion with deity it is therefore an adytum and occasions shame judge not care must be taken in the contemplation of earlier ages that there be no falling into unjust scornfulness the injustice in slavery the cruelty in the subjugation of persons and peoples must not be estimated by our standard for in that period the instinct of justice was not so highly developed who dare reproach the genoese calvin for burning the physician servetus at the stake it was a proceeding growing out of his convictions and the inquisition too had its justification the only thing is that the prevailing views were false and led to those proceedings which seem so cruel to us simply because such views have become foreign to us besides what is the burning alive of one individual compared with eternal hell pains for everybody else and yet this idea then had hold of all the world without in the least vitiating with its frightfulness the other idea of a god even we nowadays are hard and merciless to political revolutionists but that is because we are in the habit of believing the state a necessity and hence the cruelty of the proceeding is not so much understood as in the other cases where the points of view are repudiated the cruelty to animals shown by children and italians is due to the same misunderstanding the animal owing to the exigencies of the church catechism is placed too far below the level of mankind much too that is frightful and inhuman in history and which is almost incredible is rendered less atrocious by the reflection that the one who commands and the one who executes are different persons the former does not witness the performance and hence it makes no strong impression on him the latter obeys a superior and hence feels no responsibility most princes and military chieftains appear through lack of true perception cruel and hard without really being so egoism is not bad because the idea of the neighbor the word is of christian origin and does not correspond to truth is very weak in us and we feel ourselves in regard to him as free from responsibility as if plants and stones were involved that another is in suffering must be learned and it can never be wholly learned man always does right we do not blame nature when she sends a thunder storm and makes us wet why then do we term the man who inflicts injury immoral because in the latter case we assume a voluntary ruling free will and in the former necessity but this distinction is a delusion moreover even the intentional infliction of injury is not in all circumstances termed immoral thus we kill a fly intentionally without thinking very much about it simply because its buzzing about is disagreeable and we punish a criminal and inflict pain upon him in order to protect ourselves and society in the first case it is the individual who for the sake of preserving himself or in order to spare himself pain does injury with design in the second case it is the state all ethic deems intentional infliction of injury justified by necessity that is when it is a matter of self preservation but these two points of view are sufficient to explain all bad acts done by man to men it is desired to obtain pleasure or avoid pain in any sense it is a question always of self preservation socrates and plato are right whatever man does he always does right that is does what seems to him good advantageous according to the degree of advancement his intellect has attained which is always the measure of his rational capacity the inoffensive in badness badness has not for its object the infliction of pain upon others but simply our own satisfaction as for instance in the case of thirst for vengeance or of nerve excitation every act of teasing shows what pleasure is caused by the display of our power over others and what feelings of delight are experienced in the sense of domination is there then anything immoral in feeling pleasure in the pain of others is malicious joy devilish as schopenhauer says in the realm of nature we feel joy in breaking boughs shattering rocks fighting with wild beasts simply to attest our strength thereby should not the knowledge that another suffers on our account here in this case make the same kind of act which by the way arouses no qualms of conscience in us immoral also but if we had not this knowledge there would be no pleasure in one s own superiority or power for this pleasure is experienced only in the suffering of another as in the case of teasing all pleasure is in itself neither good nor bad whence comes the conviction that one should not cause pain in others in order to feel pleasure oneself simply from the standpoint of utility that is in consideration of the consequences of ultimate pain since the injured party or state will demand satisfaction and revenge this consideration alone can have led to the determination to renounce such pleasure sympathy has the satisfaction of others in view no more than as already stated badness has the pain of others in view for there are at least two perhaps many more elementary ingredients in personal gratification which enter largely into our self satisfaction one of them being the pleasure of the emotion of which species is sympathy with tragedy and another when the impulse is to action being the pleasure of exercising one s power should a sufferer be very dear to us we divest ourselves of pain by the performance of acts of sympathy with the exception of some few philosophers men have placed sympathy very low in the rank of moral feelings and rightly self defence if self defence is in general held a valid justification then nearly every manifestation of so called immoral egoism must be justified too pain is inflicted robbery or killing done in order to maintain life or to protect oneself and ward off harm a man lies when cunning and delusion are valid means of self preservation to injure intentionally when our safety and our existence are involved or the continuance of our well being is conceded to be moral the state itself injures from this motive when it hangs criminals in unintentional injury the immoral of course can not be present as accident alone is involved but is there any sort of intentional injury in which our existence and the maintenance of our well being be not involved is there such a thing as injuring from absolute badness for example in the case of cruelty if a man does not know what pain an act occasions that act is not one of wickedness thus the child is not bad to the animal not evil it disturbs and rends it as if it were one of its playthings does a man ever fully know how much pain an act may cause another as far as our nervous system extends we shield ourselves from pain if it extended further that is to our fellow men we would never cause anyone else any pain except in such cases as we cause it to ourselves when we cut ourselves surgically to heal our ills or strive and trouble ourselves to gain health we conclude from analogy that something pains somebody and can in consequence through recollection and the power of imagination feel pain also but what a difference there always is between the tooth ache and the pain sympathy that the spectacle of tooth ache occasions therefore when injury is inflicted from so called badness the degree of pain thereby experienced is always unknown to us in so far however as pleasure is felt in the act a sense of one s own power of one s own excitation the act is committed to maintain the well being of the individual and hence comes under the purview of self defence and lying for self preservation without pleasure there is no life the struggle for pleasure is the struggle for life whether the individual shall carry on this struggle in such a way that he be called good or in such a way that he be called bad is something that the standard and the capacity of his own intellect must determine for him justice that rewards whoever has fully understood the doctrine of absolute irresponsibility can no longer include the so called rewarding and punishing justice in the idea of justice if the latter be taken to mean that to each be given his due for he who is punished does not deserve the punishment he is used simply as a means to intimidate others from certain acts equally he who is rewarded does not merit the reward he could not act any differently than he did act hence the reward has only the significance of an encouragement to him and others as a motive for subsequent acts the praise is called out only to him who is running in the race and not to him who has arrived at the goal something that comes to someone as his own is neither a punishment nor a reward it is given to him from utiliarian considerations without his having any claim to it in justice hence one must say the wise man praises not because a good act has been done precisely as was once said the wise man punishes not because a bad act has been done but in order that a bad act may not be done if punishment and reward ceased there would cease with them the most powerful incentives to certain acts and away from other acts the purposes of men demand their continuance of punishment and reward and inasmuch as punishment and reward blame and praise operate most potently upon vanity these same purposes of men imperatively require the continuance of vanity the water fall at the sight of a water fall we may opine that in the countless curves spirations and dashes of the waves we behold freedom of the will and of the impulses but everything is compulsory everything can be mathematically calculated thus it is too with human acts we would be able to calculate in advance every single action if we were all knowing as well as every advance in knowledge every delusion every bad deed the acting individual himself is held fast in the illusion of volition if on a sudden the entire movement of the world stopped short and an all knowing and reasoning intelligence were there to take advantage of this pause he could foretell the future of every being to the remotest ages and indicate the path that would be taken in the world s further course the deception of the acting individual as regards himself the assumption of the freedom of the will is a part of this computable mechanism non responsibility and non guilt the absolute irresponsibility of man for his acts and his nature is the bitterest drop in the cup of him who has knowledge if he be accustomed to behold in responsibility and duty the patent of nobility of his human nature all his estimates preferences dislikes are thus made worthless and false his deepest sentiment with which he honored the sufferer the hero sprang from an error he may no longer praise no longer blame for it is irrational to blame and praise nature and necessity just as he cherishes the beautiful work of art but does not praise it as it is incapable of doing anything for itself just as he stands in the presence of plants he must stand in the presence of human conduct his own included he may admire strength beauty capacity therein but he can discern no merit the chemical process and the conflict of the elements the ordeal of the invalid who strives for convalescence are no more merits than the soul struggles and extremities in which one is torn this way and that by contending motives until one finally decides in favor of the strongest as the phrase has it although in fact it is the strongest motive that decides for us all these motives however whatever fine names we may give them have grown from the same roots in which we believe the baneful poisons lurk between good and bad actions there is no difference in kind but at most in degree good acts are sublimated evil bad acts are degraded imbruted good the very longing of the individual for self gratification together with the fear of being deprived of it obtains satisfaction in all circumstances let the individual act as he may that is as he must be it in deeds of vanity revenge pleasure utility badness cunning be it in deeds of self sacrifice sympathy or knowledge the degrees of rational capacity determine the direction in which this longing impels every society every individual has constantly present a comparative classification of benefits in accordance with which conduct is determined and others are judged but this standard perpetually changes many acts are called bad that are only stupid because the degree of intelligence that decided for them was low indeed in a certain sense all acts now are stupid for the highest degree of human intelligence that has yet been attained will in time most certainly be surpassed and then in retrospection all our present conduct and opinion will appear as narrow and petty as we now deem the conduct and opinion of savage peoples and ages to perceive all these things may occasion profound pain but there is nevertheless a consolation such pains are birth pains the butterfly insists upon breaking through the cocoon he presses through it tears it to pieces only to be blinded and confused by the strange light by the realm of liberty by such men as are capable of this sadness how few there are will the first attempt be made to see if humanity may convert itself from a thing of morality to a thing of wisdom the sun of a new gospel sheds its first ray upon the loftiest height in the souls of those few but the clouds are massed there too thicker than ever and not far apart are the brightest sunlight and the deepest gloom everything is necessity so says the new knowledge and this knowledge is itself necessity all is guiltlessness and knowledge is the way to insight into this guiltlessness if pleasure egoism vanity be necessary to attest the moral phenomena and their richest blooms the instinct for truth and accuracy of knowledge if delusion and confusion of the imagination were the only means whereby mankind could gradually lift itself up to this degree of self enlightenment and self emancipation who would venture to disparage the means who would have the right to feel sad if made aware of the goal to which those paths lead everything in the domain of ethic is evolved changeable tottering all things flow it is true but all things are also in the stream to their goal though within us the hereditary habit of erroneous judgment love hate may be ever dominant yet under the influence of awaking knowledge it will ever become weaker a new habit that of understanding not loving not hating looking from above grows up within us gradually and in the same soil and may perhaps in thousands of years be powerful enough to endow mankind with capacity to develop the wise guiltless man conscious of guiltlessness as unfailingly as it now developes the unwise irrational guilt conscious man that is to say the necessary higher step not the opposite of it the religious life the double contest against evil if an evil afflicts us we can either so deal with it as to remove its cause or else so deal with it that its effect upon our feeling is changed hence look upon the evil as a benefit of which the uses will perhaps first become evident in some subsequent period religion and art and also the metaphysical philosophy strive to effect an alteration of the feeling partly by an alteration of our judgment respecting the experience for example with the aid of the dictum whom god loves he chastizes partly by the awakening of a joy in pain in emotion especially whence the art of tragedy had its origin the more one is disposed to interpret away and justify the less likely he is to look directly at the causes of evil and eliminate them an instant alleviation and narcotizing of pain as is usual in the case of tooth ache is sufficient for him even in the severest suffering the more the domination of religions and of all narcotic arts declines the more searchingly do men look to the elimination of evil itself which is a rather bad thing for the tragic poets for there is ever less and less material for tragedy since the domain of unsparing immutable destiny grows constantly more circumscribed and a still worse thing for the priests for these last have lived heretofore upon the narcoticizing of human ill sorrow is knowledge how willingly would not one exchange the false assertions of the homines religiosi that there is a god who commands us to be good who is the sentinel and witness of every act every moment every thought who loves us who plans our welfare in every misfortune how willingly would not one exchange these for truths as healing beneficial and grateful as those delusions but there are no such truths philosophy can at most set up in opposition to them other metaphysical plausibilities fundamental untruths as well the tragedy of it all is that although one cannot believe these dogmas of religion and metaphysics if one adopts in heart and head the potent methods of truth one has yet become through human evolution so tender susceptible sensitive as to stand in need of the most effective means of rest and consolation from this state of things arises the danger that through the perception of truth or more accurately seeing through delusion one may bleed to death byron has put this into deathless verse sorrow is knowledge they who know the most must mourn the deepest o er the fatal truth the tree of knowledge is not that of life against such cares there is no better protective than the light fancy of horace at any rate during the darkest hours and sun eclipses of the soul expressed in the words quid aeternis minorem consiliis animum fatigas cur non sub alta vel platano vel hac pinu jacentes then wherefore should you who are mortal outwear your soul with a profitless burden of care say why should we not flung at ease neath this pine or a plane tree s broad umbrage quaff gaily our wine translation of sir theodore martin at any rate light fancy or heavy heartedness of any degree must be better than a romantic retrogression and desertion of one s flag an approach to christianity in any form for with it in the present state of knowledge one can have nothing to do without hopelessly defiling one s intellectual integrity and surrendering it unconditionally these woes may be painful enough but without pain one cannot become a leader and guide of humanity and woe to him who would be such and lacks this pure integrity of the intellect the truth in religion in the ages of enlightenment justice was not done to the importance of religion of this there can be no doubt it is also equally certain that in the ensuing reaction of enlightenment the demands of justice were far exceeded inasmuch as religion was treated with love even with infatuation and proclaimed as a profound indeed the most profound knowledge of the world which science had but to divest of its dogmatic garb in order to possess truth in its unmythical form religions must therefore this was the contention of all foes of enlightenment sensu allegorico with regard for the comprehension of the masses give expression to that ancient truth which is wisdom in itself inasmuch as all science of modern times has led up to it instead of away from it so that between the most ancient wisdom of man and all later wisdom there prevails harmony even similarity of viewpoint and the advancement of knowledge if one be disposed to concede such a thing has to do not with its nature but with its propagation this whole conception of religion and science is through and through erroneous and none would to day be hardy enough to countenance it had not schopenhauer s rhetoric taken it under protection this high sounding rhetoric which now gains auditors after the lapse of a generation much as may be gained from schopenhauer s religio ethical human and cosmical oracle as regards the comprehension of christianity and other religions it is nevertheless certain that he erred regarding the value of religion to knowledge he himself was in this but a servile pupil of the scientific teachers of his time who had all taken romanticism under their protection and renounced the spirit of enlightenment had he been born in our own time it would have been impossible for him to have spoken of the sensus allegoricus of religion he would instead have done truth the justice to say never has a religion directly or indirectly either as dogma or as allegory contained a truth for all religions grew out of dread or necessity and came into existence through an error of the reason they have perhaps in times of danger from science incorporated some philosophical doctrine or other into their systems in order to make it possible to continue one s existence within them but this is but a theological work of art dating from the time in which a religion began to doubt of itself these theological feats of art which are most common in christianity as the religion of a learned age impregnated with philosophy have led to this superstition of the sensus allegoricus as has even more the habit of the philosophers namely those half natures the poetical philosophers and the philosophising artists of dealing with their own feelings as if they constituted the fundamental nature of humanity and hence of giving their own religious feelings a predominant influence over the structure of their systems as the philosophers mostly philosophised under the influence of hereditary religious habits or at least under the traditional influence of this metaphysical necessity they naturally arrived at conclusions closely resembling the judaic or christian or indian religious tenets resembling in the way that children are apt to look like their mothers only in this case the fathers were not certain as to the maternity as easily happens but in the innocence of their admiration they fabled regarding the family likeness of all religion and science in reality there exists between religion and true science neither relationship nor friendship not even enmity they dwell in different spheres every philosophy that lets the religious comet gleam through the darkness of its last outposts renders everything within it that purports to be science suspicious it is all probably religion although it may assume the guise of science moreover though all the peoples agree concerning certain religious things for example the existence of a god which by the way as regards this point is not the case this fact would constitute an argument against the thing agreed upon for example the very existence of a god the consensus gentium and especially hominum can probably amount only to an absurdity against it there is no consensus omnium sapientium whatever on any point with the exception of which goethe s verse speaks all greatest sages to all latest ages will smile wink and slily agree tis folly to wait till a fool s empty pate has learned to be knowing and free so children of wisdom must look upon fools as creatures who re never the better for schools stated without rhyme or metre and adapted to our case the consensus sapientium is to the effect that the consensus gentium amounts to an absurdity origin of religious worship let us transport ourselves back to the times in which religious life flourished most vigorously and we will find a fundamental conviction prevalent which we no longer share and which has resulted in the closing of the door to religious life once for all so far as we are concerned this conviction has to do with nature and intercourse with her in those times nothing is yet known of nature s laws neither for earth nor for heaven is there a must a season sunshine rain can come or stay away as it pleases there is wanting in particular all idea of natural causation if a man rows it is not the oar that moves the boat but rowing is a magical ceremony whereby a demon is constrained to move the boat all illness death itself is a consequence of magical influences in sickness and death nothing natural is conceived the whole idea of natural course is wanting the idea dawns first upon the ancient greeks that is to say in a very late period of humanity in the conception of a moira fate ruling over the gods if any person shoots off a bow there is always an irrational strength and agency in the act if the wells suddenly run dry the first thought is of subterranean demons and their pranks it must have been the dart of a god beneath whose invisible influence a human being suddenly collapses in india the carpenter according to lubbock is in the habit of making devout offerings to his hammer and hatchet a brahmin treats the plume with which he writes a soldier the weapon that he takes into the field a mason his trowel a laborer his plow in the same way all nature is in the opinion of religious people a sum total of the doings of conscious and willing beings an immense mass of complex volitions in regard to all that takes place outside of us no conclusion is permissible that anything will result thus and so must result thus and so that we are comparatively calculable and certain in our experiences that man is the rule nature the ruleless this view forms the fundamental conviction that dominates crude religion producing early civilizations we contemporary men feel exactly the opposite the richer man now feels himself inwardly the more polyphone the music and the sounding of his soul the more powerfully does the uniformity of nature impress him we all with goethe recognize in nature the great means of repose for the soul we listen to the pendulum stroke of this great clock with longing for rest for absolute calm and quiescence as if we could drink in the uniformity of nature and thereby arrive first at an enjoyment of oneself formerly it was the reverse if we carry ourselves back to the periods of crude civilization or if we contemplate contemporary savages we will find them most strongly influenced by rule by tradition the individual is almost automatically bound to rule and tradition and moves with the uniformity of a pendulum to him nature the uncomprehended fearful mysterious nature must seem the domain of freedom of volition of higher power indeed as an ultra human degree of destiny as god every individual in such periods and circumstances feels that his existence his happiness the existence and happiness of the family the state the success or failure of every undertaking must depend upon these dispositions of nature certain natural events must occur at the proper time and certain others must not occur how can influence be exercised over this fearful unknown how can this domain of freedom be brought under subjection thus he asks himself thus he worries is there no means to render these powers of nature as subject to rule and tradition as you are yourself the cogitation of the superstitious and magic deluded man is upon the theme of imposing a law upon nature and to put it briefly religious worship is the result of such cogitation the problem which is present to every man is closely connected with this one how can the weaker party dictate laws to the stronger control its acts in reference to the weaker at first the most harmless form of influence is recollected that influence which is acquired when the partiality of anyone has been won through beseeching and prayer through abject humiliation through obligations to regular gifts and propitiations through flattering homages it is possible therefore to impose some guidance upon the forces of nature to the extent that their partiality be won love binds and is bound then agreements can be entered into by means of which certain courses of conduct are mutually concluded vows are made and authorities prescribed but far more potent is that species of power exercised by means of magic and incantation as a man is able to injure a powerful enemy by means of the magician and render him helpless with fear as the love potion operates at a distance so can the mighty forces of nature in the opinion of weaker mankind be controlled by similar means the principal means of effecting incantations is to acquire control of something belonging to the party to be influenced hair finger nails food from his table even his picture or his name with such apparatus it is possible to act by means of magic for the basic principle is that to everything spiritual corresponds something corporeal with the aid of this corporeal element the spirit may be bound injured or destroyed the corporeal affords the handle by which the spiritual can be laid hold of in the same way that man influences mankind does he influences some spirit of nature for this latter has also its corporeal element that can be grasped the tree and on the same basis the seed from which it grew this puzzling sequence seems to demonstrate that in both forms the same spirit is embodied now large now small a stone that suddenly rolls is the body in which the spirit works does a huge boulder lie in a lonely moor it is impossible to think of mortal power having placed it there the stone must have moved itself there that is to say some spirit must dominate it everything that has a body is subject to magic including therefore the spirits of nature if a god is directly connected with his portrait a direct influence by refraining from devout offerings by whippings chainings and the like can be brought to bear upon him the lower classes in china tie cords around the picture of their god in order to defy his departing favor when he has left them in the lurch and tear the picture to pieces drag it through the streets into dung heaps and gutters crying you dog of a spirit we housed you in a beautiful temple we gilded you prettily we fed you well we brought you offerings and yet how ungrateful you are similar displays of resentment have been made against pictures of the mother of god and pictures of saints in catholic countries during the present century when such pictures would not do their duty during times of pestilence and drought through all these magical relationships to nature countless ceremonies are occasioned and finally when their complexity and confusion grow too great pains are taken to systematize them to arrange them so that the favorable course of nature s progress namely the great yearly circle of the seasons may be brought about by a corresponding course of the ceremonial progress the aim of religious worship is to influence nature to human advantage and hence to instil a subjection to law into her that originally she has not whereas at present man desires to find out the subjection to law of nature in order to guide himself thereby in brief the system of religious worship rests upon the idea of magic between man and man and the magician is older than the priest but it rests equally upon other and higher ideas it brings into prominence the sympathetic relation of man to man the existence of benevolence gratitude prayer of truces between enemies of loans upon security of arrangements for the protection of property man even in very inferior degrees of civilization does not stand in the presence of nature as a helpless slave he is not willy nilly the absolute servant of nature in the greek development of religion especially in the relationship to the olympian gods it becomes possible to entertain the idea of an existence side by side of two castes a higher more powerful and a lower less powerful but both are bound together in some way on account of their origin and are one species they need not be ashamed of one another this is the element of distinction in greek religion at the contemplation of certain ancient sacrificial proceedings how many sentiments are lost to us is manifest in the union of the farcical even of the obscene with the religious feeling the feeling that this mixture is possible is becoming extinct we realize the mixture only historically in the mysteries of demeter and dionysos and in the christian easter festivals and religious mysteries but we still perceive the sublime in connection with the ridiculous and the like the emotional with the absurd perhaps a later age will be unable to understand even these combinations christianity as antiquity when on a sunday morning we hear the old bells ringing we ask ourselves is it possible all this for a jew crucified two thousand years ago who said he was god s son the proof of such an assertion is lacking certainly the christian religion constitutes in our time a protruding bit of antiquity from very remote ages and that its assertions are still generally believed although men have become so keen in the scrutiny of claims constitutes the oldest relic of this inheritance a god who begets children by a mortal woman a sage who demands that no more work be done that no more justice be administered but that the signs of the approaching end of the world be heeded a system of justice that accepts an innocent as a vicarious sacrifice in the place of the guilty a person who bids his disciples drink his blood prayers for miracles sins against a god expiated upon a god fear of a hereafter to which death is the portal the figure of the cross as a symbol in an age that no longer knows the purpose and the ignominy of the cross how ghostly all these things flit before us out of the grave of their primitive antiquity is one to believe that such things can still be believed the un greek in christianity the greeks did not look upon the homeric gods above them as lords nor upon themselves beneath as servants after the fashion of the jews they saw but the counterpart as in a mirror of the most perfect specimens of their own caste hence an ideal but no contradiction of their own nature there was a feeling of mutual relationship resulting in a mutual interest a sort of alliance man thinks well of himself when he gives himself such gods and places himself in a relationship akin to that of the lower nobility with the higher whereas the italian races have a decidedly vulgar religion involving perpetual anxiety because of bad and mischievous powers and soul disturbers wherever the olympian gods receded into the background there even greek life became gloomier and more perturbed christianity on the other hand oppressed and degraded humanity completely and sank it into deepest mire into the feeling of utter abasement it suddenly flashed the gleam of divine compassion so that the amazed and grace dazzled stupefied one gave a cry of delight and for a moment believed that the whole of heaven was within him upon this unhealthy excess of feeling upon the accompanying corruption of heart and head christianity attains all its psychological effects it wants to annihilate debase stupefy amaze bedazzle there is but one thing that it does not want measure standard das maas and therefore is it in the worst sense barbarous asiatic vulgar un greek being religious to some purpose there are certain insipid traffic virtuous people to whom religion is pinned like the hem of some garb of a higher humanity these people do well to remain religious it adorns them all who are not versed in some professional weapon including tongue and pen as weapons are servile to all such the christian religion is very useful for then their servility assumes the aspect of christian virtue and is amazingly adorned people whose daily lives are empty and colorless are readily religious this is comprehensible and pardonable but they have no right to demand that others whose daily lives are not empty and colorless should be religious also the everyday christian if christianity with its allegations of an avenging god universal sinfulness choice of grace and the danger of eternal damnation were true it would be an indication of weakness of mind and character not to be a priest or an apostle or a hermit and toil for one s own salvation it would be irrational to lose sight of one s eternal well being in comparison with temporary advantage assuming these dogmas to be generally believed the every day christian is a pitiable figure a man who really cannot count as far as three and who for the rest just because of his intellectual incapacity does not deserve to be as hard punished as christianity promises he shall be concerning the cleverness of christianity it is a master stroke of christianity to so emphasize the unworthiness sinfulness and degradation of men in general that contempt of one s fellow creatures becomes impossible he may sin as much as he pleases he is not by nature different from me it is i who in every way am unworthy and contemptible so says the christian to himself but even this feeling has lost its keenest sting for the christian does not believe in his individual degradation he is bad in his general human capacity and he soothes himself a little with the assertion that we are all alike personal change as soon as a religion rules it has for its opponents those who were its first disciples fate of christianity christianity arose to lighten the heart but now it must first make the heart heavy in order to be able to lighten it afterwards christianity will consequently go down the testimony of pleasure the agreeable opinion is accepted as true this is the testimony of pleasure or as the church says the evidence of strength of which all religions are so proud although they should all be ashamed of it if a belief did not make blessed it would not be believed how little it would be worth then dangerous play whoever gives religious feeling room must then also let it grow he can do nothing else then his being gradually changes the religious element brings with it affinities and kinships the whole circle of his judgment and feeling is clouded and draped in religious shadows feeling cannot stand still one should be on one s guard the blind pupil as long as one knows very well the strength and the weakness of one s dogma one s art one s religion its strength is still low the pupil and apostle who has no eye for the weaknesses of a dogma a religion and so on dazzled by the aspect of the master and by his own reverence for him has on that very account generally more power than the master without blind pupils the influence of a man and his work has never become great to give victory to knowledge often amounts to no more than so allying it with stupidity that the brute force of the latter forces triumph for the former the breaking off of churches there is not sufficient religion in the world merely to put an end to the number of religions sinlessness of men if one have understood how sin came into the world namely through errors of the reason through which men in their intercourse with one another and even individual men looked upon themselves as much blacker and wickeder than was really the case one s whole feeling is much lightened and man and the world appear together in such a halo of harmlessness that a sentiment of well being is instilled into one s whole nature man in the midst of nature is as a child left to its own devices this child indeed dreams a heavy anxious dream but when it opens its eyes it finds itself always in paradise irreligiousness of artists homer is so much at home among his gods and is as a poet so good natured to them that he must have been profoundly irreligious that which was brought to him by the popular faith a mean crude and partially repulsive superstition he dealt with as freely as the sculptor with his clay therefore with the same freedom that schylus and aristophanes evinced and with which in later times the great artists of the renaissance and also shakespeare and goethe drew their pictures art and strength of false interpretation all the visions fears exhaustions and delights of the saint are well known symptoms of sickness which in him owing to deep rooted religious and psychological delusions are explained quite differently that is not as symptoms of sickness so too perhaps the demon of socrates was nothing but a malady of the ear that he explained in view of his predominant moral theory in a manner different from what would be thought rational to day nor is the case different with the frenzy and the frenzied speeches of the prophets and of the priests of the oracles it is always the degree of wisdom imagination capacity and morality in the heart and mind of the interpreters that got so much out of them it is among the greatest feats of the men who are called geniuses and saints that they made interpreters for themselves who fortunately for mankind did not understand them reverence for madness because it was perceived that an excitement of some kind often made the head clearer and occasioned fortunate inspirations it was concluded that the utmost excitement would occasion the most fortunate inspirations hence the frenzied being was revered as a sage and an oracle giver a false conclusion lies at the bottom of all this promises of wisdom modern science has as its object as little pain as possible as long a life as possible hence a sort of eternal blessedness but of a very limited kind in comparison with the promises of religion forbidden generosity there is not enough of love and goodness in the world to throw any of it away on conceited people survival of religious training in the disposition the catholic church and before it all ancient education controlled the whole domain of means through which man was put into certain unordinary moods and withdrawn from the cold calculation of personal advantage and from calm rational reflection a church vibrating with deep tones gloomy regular restraining exhortations from a priestly band who involuntarily communicate their own tension to their congregation and lead them to listen almost with anxiety as if some miracle were in course of preparation the awesome pile of architecture which as the house of a god rears itself vastly into the vague and in all its shadowy nooks inspires fear of its nerve exciting power who would care to reduce men to the level of these things if the ideas upon which they rest became extinct but the results of all these things are nevertheless not thrown away the inner world of exalted emotional prophetic profoundly repentant hope blessed moods has become inborn in man largely through cultivation what still exists in his soul was formerly as he germinated grew and bloomed thoroughly disciplined religious after pains though one believe oneself absolutely weaned away from religion the process has yet not been so thorough as to make impossible a feeling of joy at the presence of religious feelings and dispositions without intelligible content as for example in music and if a philosophy alleges to us the validity of metaphysical hopes through the peace of soul therein attainable and also speaks of the whole true gospel in the look of raphael s madonna we greet such declarations and innuendoes with a welcome smile the philosopher has here a matter easy of demonstration he responds with that which he is glad to give namely a heart that is glad to accept hence it is observable how the less reflective free spirits collide only with dogmas but yield readily to the magic of religious feelings it is a source of pain to them to let the latter go simply on account of the former scientific philosophy must be very much on its guard lest on account of this necessity an evolved and hence also a transitory necessity delusions are smuggled in even logicians speak of presentiments of truth in ethics and in art for example of the presentiment that the essence of things is unity a thing which nevertheless ought to be prohibited between carefully deduced truths and such foreboded things there lies the abysmal distinction that the former are products of the intellect and the latter of the necessity hunger is no evidence that there is food at hand to appease it hunger merely craves food presentiment does not denote that the existence of a thing is known in any way whatever it denotes merely that it is deemed possible to the extent that it is desired or feared the presentiment is not one step forward in the domain of certainty it is involuntarily believed that the religious tinted sections of a philosophy are better attested than the others but the case is at bottom just the opposite there is simply the inner wish that it may be so that the thing which beautifies may also be true this wish leads us to accept bad grounds as good of the christian need of salvation careful consideration must render it possible to propound some explanation of that process in the soul of a christian which is termed need of salvation and to propound an explanation too free from mythology hence one purely psychological heretofore psychological explanations of religious conditions and processes have really been in disrepute inasmuch as a theology calling itself free gave vent to its unprofitable nature in this domain for its principal aim so far as may be judged from the spirit of its creator schleier macher was the preservation of the christian religion and the maintenance of the christian theology it appeared that in the psychological analysis of religious facts a new anchorage and above all a new calling were to be gained undisturbed by such predecessors we venture the following exposition of the phenomena alluded to man is conscious of certain acts which are very firmly implanted in the general course of conduct indeed he discovers in himself a predisposition to such acts that seems to him to be as unalterable as his very being how gladly he would essay some other kind of acts which in the general estimate of conduct are rated the best and highest how gladly he would welcome the consciousness of well doing which ought to follow unselfish motive unfortunately however it goes no further than this longing the discontent consequent upon being unable to satisfy it is added to all other kinds of discontent which result from his life destiny in particular or which may be due to so called bad acts so that a deep depression ensues accompanied by a desire for some physician to remove it and all its causes this condition would not be found so bitter if the individual but compared himself freely with other men for then he would have no reason to be discontented with himself in particular as he is merely bearing his share of the general burden of human discontent and incompleteness but he compares himself with a being who alone must be capable of the conduct that is called unegoistic and of an enduring consciousness of unselfish motive with god it is because he gazes into this clear mirror that his own self seems so extraordinarily distracted and so troubled thereupon the thought of that being in so far as it flits before his fancy as retributive justice occasions him anxiety in every conceivable small and great experience he believes he sees the anger of the being his threats the very implements and manacles of his judge and prison what succors him in this danger which in the prospect of an eternal duration of punishment transcends in hideousness all the horrors that can be presented to the imagination before we consider this condition in its further effects we would admit to ourselves that man is betrayed into this condition not through his fault and sin but through a series of delusions of the reason that it was the fault of the mirror if his own self appeared to him in the highest degree dark and hateful and that that mirror was his own work the very imperfect work of human imagination and judgment in the first place a being capable of absolutely unegoistic conduct is as fabulous as the phoenix such a being is not even thinkable for the very reason that the whole notion of unegoistic conduct when closely examined vanishes into air never yet has a man done anything solely for others and entirely without reference to a personal motive indeed how could he possibly do anything that had no reference to himself that is without inward compulsion which must always have its basis in a personal need how could the ego act without ego a god who on the other hand is all love as he is usually represented would not be capable of a solitary unegoistic act whence one is reminded of a reflection of lichtenberg s which is in truth taken from a lower sphere we cannot possibly feel for others as the expression goes we feel only for ourselves the assertion sounds hard but it is not if rightly understood a man loves neither his father nor his mother nor his wife nor his child but simply the feelings which they inspire or as la rochefoucauld says if you think you love your mistress for the mere love of her you are very much mistaken why acts of love are more highly prized than others namely not on account of their nature but on account of their utility has already been explained in the section on the origin of moral feelings but if a man should wish to be all love like the god aforesaid and want to do all things for others and nothing for himself the procedure would be fundamentally impossible because he must do a great deal for himself before there would be any possibility of doing anything for the love of others it is also essential that others be sufficiently egoistic to accept always and at all times this self sacrifice and living for others so that the men of love and self sacrifice have an interest in the survival of unloving and selfish egoists while the highest morality in order to maintain itself must formally enforce the existence of immorality wherein it would be really destroying itself further the idea of a god perturbs and discourages as long as it is accepted but as to how it originated can no longer in the present state of comparative ethnological science be a matter of doubt and with the insight into the origin of this belief all faith collapses what happens to the christian who compares his nature with that of god is exactly what happened to don quixote who depreciated his own prowess because his head was filled with the wondrous deeds of the heroes of chivalrous romance the standard of measurement which both employ belongs to the domain of fable but if the idea of god collapses so too does the feeling of sin as a violation of divine rescript as a stain upon a god like creation there still apparently remains that discouragement which is closely allied with fear of the punishment of worldly justice or of the contempt of one s fellow men the keenest thorn in the sentiment of sin is dulled when it is perceived that one s acts have contravened human tradition human rules and human laws without having thereby endangered the eternal salvation of the soul and its relations with deity if finally men attain to the conviction of the absolute necessity of all acts and of their utter irresponsibility and then absorb it into their flesh and blood every relic of conscience pangs will disappear if now as stated the christian through certain delusive feelings is betrayed into self contempt that is by a false and unscientific view of his acts and feelings he must nevertheless perceive with the utmost amazement that this state of self contempt of conscience pangs of despair in particular does not last that there are hours during which all these things are wafted away from the soul and he feels himself once more free and courageous the truth is that joy in his own being the fulness of his own powers in connection with the inevitable decline of his profound excitation with the lapse of time bore off the palm of victory the man loves himself once more he feels it but this very new love this new self esteem seems to him incredible he can see in it only the wholly unmerited stream of the light of grace shed down upon him if he formerly saw in every event merely warnings threats punishments and every kind of indication of divine anger he now reads into his experiences the grace of god the latter circumstance seems to him full of love the former as a helpful pointing of the way and his entirely joyful frame of mind now seems to him to be an absolute proof of the goodness of god as formerly in his states of discouragement he interpreted his conduct falsely so now he does the same with his experiences his state of consolation is now regarded as the effect produced by some external power the love with which at bottom he loves himself seems to be the divine love that which he calls grace and the preliminary of salvation is in reality self grace self salvation therefore a certain false psychology a certain kind of imaginativeness in the interpretation of motives and experiences is the essential preliminary to being a christian and to experiencing the need of salvation upon gaining an insight into this wandering of the reason and the imagination one ceases to be a christian of christian asceticism and sanctity much as some thinkers have exerted themselves to impart an air of the miraculous to those singular phenomena known as asceticism and sanctity to question which or to account for which upon a rational basis would be wickedness and sacrilege the temptation to this wickedness is none the less great a powerful impulse of nature has in every age led to protest against such phenomena at any rate science inasmuch as it is the imitation of nature permits the casting of doubts upon the inexplicable character and the supernal degree of such phenomena it is true that heretofore science has not succeeded in its attempts at explanation the phenomena remain unexplained still to the great satisfaction of those who revere moral miracles for speaking generally the unexplained must rank as the inexplicable the inexplicable as the non natural supernatural miraculous so runs the demand in the souls of all the religious and all the metaphysicians even the artists if they happen to be thinkers whereas the scientific man sees in this demand the evil principle the universal first apparent truth that is encountered in the contemplation of sanctity and asceticism is that their nature is complicated for nearly always within the physical world as well as in the moral the apparently miraculous may be traced successfully to the complex the obscure the multi conditioned let us venture then to isolate a few impulses in the soul of the saint and the ascetic to consider them separately and then view them as a synthetic development there is an obstinacy against oneself certain sublimated forms of which are included in asceticism certain kinds of men are under such a strong necessity of exercising their power and dominating impulses that if other objects are lacking or if they have not succeeded with other objects they will actually tyrannize over some portions of their own nature or over sections and stages of their own personality thus do many thinkers bring themselves to views which are far from likely to increase or improve their fame many deliberately bring down the contempt of others upon themselves although they could easily have retained consideration by silence others contradict earlier opinions and do not shrink from the ordeal of being deemed inconsistent on the contrary they strive for this and act like eager riders who enjoy horseback exercise most when the horse is skittish thus will men in dangerous paths ascend to the highest steeps in order to laugh to scorn their own fear and their own trembling limbs thus will the philosopher embrace the dogmas of asceticism humility sanctity in the light of which his own image appears in its most hideous aspect this crushing of self this mockery of one s own nature this spernere se sperni out of which religions have made so much is in reality but a very high development of vanity the whole ethic of the sermon on the mount belongs in this category man has a true delight in mastering himself through exaggerated pretensions or excessive expedients and later deifying this tyrannically exacting something within him in every scheme of ascetic ethics man prays to one part of himself as if it were god and hence it is necessary for him to treat the rest of himself as devil man is not at all hours equally moral this is established if one s morality be judged according to one s capacity for great self sacrificing resolutions and abnegations which when continual and made a habit are known as sanctity one is in affection or disposition the most moral while higher excitement supplies wholly new impulses which were one calm and cool as ordinarily one would not deem oneself even capable of how comes this apparently from the propinquity of all great and lofty emotional states if a man is brought to an extraordinary pitch of feeling he can resolve upon a fearful revenge or upon a fearful renunciation of his thirst for vengeance indifferently he craves under the influences of powerful emotion the great the powerful the immense and if he chances to perceive that the sacrifice of himself will afford him as much satisfaction as the sacrifice of another or will afford him more he will choose self sacrifice what concerns him particularly is simply the unloading of his emotion hence he readily to relieve his tension grasps the darts of the enemy and buries them in his own breast that in self abnegation and not in revenge the element of greatness consisted must have been brought home to mankind only after long habituation a god who sacrifices himself would be the most powerful and most effective symbol of this sort of greatness as the conquest of the most hardly conquered enemy the sudden mastering of a passion thus does such abnegation appear hence it passes for the summit of morality in reality all that is involved is the exchange of one idea for another whilst the temperament remained at a like altitude a like tidal state men when coming out of the spell or resting from such passionate excitation no longer understand the morality of such instants but the admiration of all who participated in the occasion sustains them pride is their support if the passion and the comprehension of their act weaken therefore at bottom even such acts of self abnegation are not moral inasmuch as they are not done with a strict regard for others rather do others afford the high strung temperament an opportunity to lighten itself through such abnegation even the ascetic seeks to make life easier and generally by means of absolute subjection to another will or to an all inclusive rule and ritual pretty much as the brahmin leaves absolutely nothing to his own volition but is guided in every moment of his life by some holy injunction or other this subjection is a potent means of acquiring dominion over oneself one is occupied hence time does not bang heavy and there is no incitement of the personal will and of the individual passion the deed once done there is no feeling of responsibility nor the sting of regret one has given up one s own will once for all and this is easier than to give it up occasionally as it is also easier wholly to renounce a desire than to yield to it in measured degree when we consider the present relation of man to the state we perceive unconditional obedience is easier than conditional the holy person also makes his lot easier through the complete surrender of his life personality and it is all delusion to admire such a phenomenon as the loftiest heroism of morality it is always more difficult to assert one s personality without shrinking and without hesitation than to give it up altogether in the manner indicated and it requires moreover more intellect and thought after having discovered in many of the less comprehensible actions mere manifestations of pleasure in emotion for its own sake i fancy i can detect in the self contempt which characterises holy persons and also in their acts of self torture through hunger and scourgings distortions and chaining of the limbs acts of madness simply a means whereby such natures may resist the general exhaustion of their will to live their nerves they employ the most painful expedients to escape if only for a time from the heaviness and weariness in which they are steeped by their great mental indolence and their subjection to a will other than their own the most usual means by which the ascetic and the sanctified individual seeks to make life more endurable comprises certain combats of an inner nature involving alternations of victory and prostration for this purpose an enemy is necessary and he is found in the so called inner enemy that is the holy individual makes use of his tendency to vanity domineering and pride and of his mental longings in order to contemplate his life as a sort of continuous battle and himself as a battlefield in which good and evil spirits wage war with varying fortune it is an established fact that the imagination is restrained through the regularity and adequacy of sexual intercourse while on the other hand abstention from or great irregularity in sexual intercourse will cause the imagination to run riot the imaginations of many of the christian saints were obscene to a degree and because of the theory that sexual desires were in reality demons that raged within them the saints did not feel wholly responsible for them it is to this conviction that we are indebted for the highly instructive sincerity of their evidence against themselves it was to their interest that this contest should always be kept up in some fashion because by means of this contest as already stated their empty lives gained distraction in order that the contest might seem sufficiently great to inspire sympathy and admiration in the unsanctified it was essential that sexual capacity be ever more and more damned and denounced indeed the danger of eternal damnation was so closely allied to this capacity that for whole generations christians showed their children with actual conscience pangs what evil may not have been done to humanity through this and yet here the truth is just upside down an exceedingly unseemly attitude for the truth christianity it is true had said that every man is conceived and born in sin and in the intolerable and excessive christianity of calderon this thought is again perverted and entangled into the most distorted paradox extant in the well known lines the greatest sin of man is the sin of being born in all pessimistic religions the act of procreation is looked upon as evil in itself this is far from being the general human opinion it is not even the opinion of all pessimists empedocles for example knows nothing of anything shameful devilish and sinful in it he sees rather in the great field of bliss of unholiness simply a healthful and hopeful phenomenon aphrodite she is to him an evidence that strife does not always rage but that some time a gentle demon is to wield the sceptre the christian pessimists of practice had as stated a direct interest in the prevalence of an opposite belief they needed in the loneliness and the spiritual wilderness of their lives an ever living enemy and a universally known enemy through whose conquest they might appear to the unsanctified as utterly incomprehensible and half unnatural beings when this enemy at last as a result of their mode of life and their shattered health took flight forever they were able immediately to people their inner selves with new demons the rise and fall of the balance of cheerfulness and despair maintained their addled brains in a totally new fluctuation of longing and peace of soul and in that period psychology served not only to cast suspicion on everything human but to wound and scourge it to crucify it man wanted to find himself as base and evil as possible man sought to become anxious about the state of his soul he wished to be doubtful of his own capacity everything natural with which man connects the idea of badness and sinfulness as for instance is still customary in regard to the erotic injures and degrades the imagination occasions a shamed aspect leads man to war upon himself and makes him uncertain distrustful of himself even his dreams acquire a tincture of the unclean conscience and yet this suffering because of the natural element in certain things is wholly superfluous it is simply the result of opinions regarding the things it is easy to understand why men become worse than they are if they are brought to look upon the unavoidably natural as bad and later to feel it as of evil origin it is the master stroke of religions and metaphysics that wish to make man out bad and sinful by nature to render nature suspicious in his eyes and to so make himself evil for he learns to feel himself evil when he cannot divest himself of nature he gradually comes to look upon himself after a long life lived naturally so oppressed by a weight of sin that supernatural powers become necessary to relieve him of the burden and with this notion comes the so called need of salvation which is the result not of a real but of an imaginary sinfulness go through the separate moral expositions in the vouchers of christianity and it will always be found that the demands are excessive in order that it may be impossible for man to satisfy them the object is not that he may become moral but that he may feel as sinful as possible if this feeling had not been rendered agreeable to man why should he have improvised such an ideal and clung to it so long as in the ancient world an incalculable strength of intellect and capacity for feeling was squandered in order to increase the joy of living through feastful systems of worship so in the era of christianity an equally incalculable quantity of intellectual capacity has been sacrificed in another endeavor that man should in every way feel himself sinful and thereby be moved inspired inspirited to move to inspire to inspirit at any cost is not this the freedom cry of an exhausted over ripe over cultivated age the circle of all the natural sensations had been gone through a hundred times the soul had grown weary then the saints and the ascetics found a new order of ecstacies they set themselves before the eyes of all not alone as models for imitation to many but as fearful and yet delightful spectacles on the boundary line between this world and the next world where in that period everyone thought he saw at one time rays of heavenly light at another fearful threatening tongues of flame the eye of the saint directed upon the fearful significance of the shortness of earthly life upon the imminence of the last judgment upon eternal life hereafter this glowering eye in an emaciated body caused men in the old time world to tremble to the depths of their being to look to look away and shudder to feel anew the fascination of the spectacle to yield to it sate oneself upon it until the soul trembled with ardor and fever that was the last pleasure left to classical antiquity when its sensibilities had been blunted by the arena and the gladiatorial show to sum up all that has been said that condition of soul at which the saint or expectant saint is rejoiced is a combination of elements which we are all familiar with except that under other influences than those of mere religious ideation they customarily arouse the censure of men in the same way that when combined with religion itself and regarded as the supreme attainment of sanctity they are object of admiration and even of prayer at least in more simple times very soon the saint turns upon himself that severity that is so closely allied to the instinct of domination at any price and which inspire even in the most solitary individual the sense of power soon his swollen sensitiveness of feeling breaks forth from the longing to restrain his passions within it and is transformed into a longing to master them as if they were wild steeds the master impulse being ever that of a proud spirit next he craves a complete cessation of all perturbing fascinating feelings a waking sleep an enduring repose in the lap of a dull animal plant like indolence next he seeks the battle and extinguishes it within himself because weariness and boredom confront him he binds his self deification with self contempt he delights in the wild tumult of his desires and the sharp pain of sin in the very idea of being lost he is able to play his very passions for instance the desire to domineer a trick so that he goes to the other extreme of abject humiliation and subjection so that his overwrought soul is without any restraint through this antithesis and finally when indulgence in visions in talks with the dead or with divine beings overcomes him this is really but a form of gratification that he craves perhaps a form of gratification in which all other gratifications are blended novalis one of the authorities in matters of sanctity because of his experience and instinct betrays the whole secret with the utmost simplicity when he says it is remarkable that the close connection of gratification religion and cruelty has not long ago made men aware of their inner relationship and common tendency not what the saint is but what he was in the eyes of the non sanctified gives him his historical importance because there existed a delusion respecting the saint his soul states being falsely viewed and his personality being sundered as much as possible from humanity as a something incomparable and supernatural because of these things he attained the extraordinary with which he swayed the imaginations of whole nations and whole ages even he knew himself not for even he regarded his dispositions passions and actions in accordance with a system of interpretation as artificial and exaggerated as the pneumatic interpretation of the bible the distorted and diseased in his own nature with its blending of spiritual poverty defective knowledge ruined health overwrought nerves remained as hidden from his view as from the view of his beholders he was neither a particularly good man nor a particularly bad man but he stood for something that was far above the human standard in wisdom and goodness faith in him sustained faith in the divine and miraculous in a religious significance of all existence in an impending day of judgment in the last rays of the setting sun of the ancient world which fell upon the christian peoples the shadowy form of the saint attained enormous proportions to such enormous proportions indeed that down even to our own age which no longer believes in god there are thinkers who believe in the saints it stands to reason that this sketch of the saint made upon the model of the whole species can be confronted with many opposing sketches that would create a more agreeable impression there are certain exceptions among the species who distinguish themselves either by especial gentleness or especial humanity and perhaps by the strength of their own personality others are in the highest degree fascinating because certain of their delusions shed a particular glow over their whole being as is the case with the founder of christianity who took himself for the only begotten son of god and hence felt himself sinless so that through his imagination that should not be too harshly judged since the whole of antiquity swarmed with sons of god he attained the same goal the sense of complete sinlessness complete irresponsibility that can now be attained by every individual through science in the same manner i have viewed the saints of india who occupy an intermediate station between the christian saints and the greek philosophers and hence are not to be regarded as a pure type knowledge and science as far as they existed and superiority to the rest of mankind by logical discipline and training of the intellectual powers were insisted upon by the buddhists as essential to sanctity just as they were denounced by the christian world as the ind\n"

i', 't discovered that this nature even cannot be responsible ina', 'smuch as it is only and wholly a necessary consequence and i', 's synthesised out of the elements and influence of past and ', 'present things therefore that man is to be made responsible ', 'for nothing neither for his nature nor his motives nor his c', 'ourse of conduct nor his particular acts by this process is ', 'gained the knowledge that the history of moral estimates is ', 'the history of error of the error of responsibility as is wh', 'atever rests upon the error of the freedom of the will schop', 'enhauer
